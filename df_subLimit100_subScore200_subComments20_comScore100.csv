"LPT: If you want to stop overeating and improve your relationship with food, only eat in your dining area with your devices away. Having a content-free designated eating spot will make you much more sensitive to your satiety cues and make you more mindful about your diet and eating habits.","Food was not always affordable for my Latino parents growing up. For this reason I was taught to NEVER throw away food. This stuck with me and manifested itself into me becoming the food cleanup crew for family meals. Now I always finish everything single item I order and justify it by thinking “if I don’t eat this all now, it will go bad thus wasting food”

Edit: forgot to say I’m going to try this out and hopefully it will help! Stay tuned

Edit 2: Thanks for the support and ideas people! Didn’t realize how common my situation was lol. Happy to know there are others who suffer from the same mental obstacles.",iv8h0t,g5py817,2020-09-18 17:09:03

I feel hungry enough to heat up 2 burritos but let's just heat up one. If talk to myself and be like theres nothing wrong with eating 2 if we are actually hungry enough for 2 and it only takes 5 minutes to prepare and heat another burrito and if I'm really hungry enough those 5 mins will be worth it. I'd always feel full enough after the first where I couldnt justify prepping another one.

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing. I’ve never met a woman who doesn’t have a complicated relationship with food.”,"Two things really messed me up. One food insecurity.  I didn't always have enough to eat as a kid and even struggled at times in adulthood. Second I remember very clearly my mother talking about how she was the fattest girl in her grade. She was so large, she was disgusting. We found a dress she wore for her confirmation and I tried it on...I couldn't zip it. I was younger than she had been.  I remember looking at the pictures of her in it while she stressed how horribly fat she was and trying to pull the zipper. Until that moment I thought of myself as a normal kid. Thinking you are grossly fat and at the same time being truly hungry is weird. I definitely stress eat almost out of panic like my brain is afraid the food will be taken from me as punishment or because it's just gone.

Thank you for the award",kjqocu,ggyidj9,2020-12-25 03:21:48

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing. I’ve never met a woman who doesn’t have a complicated relationship with food.”,"I have a very complicated relationship with food and my body. On one hand, I’m an athlete in an image based sport - my body is constantly evaluated by others and my income depends on those evaluations being positive, which in my world means lean, flexible, strong, graceful. I am accustomed to my body being talked about like I am not there inhabiting it, to having people tell me I need to lose weight/maintain a weight, that I look best a certain way, that I’m too short or not the right “look” for a certain thing, that I need to tone up more but make sure my muscles don’t make me look bulky, stuff like that. It’s part of my life. I also love to cook and bake, I enjoy trying new things and experimenting with how to make them, and I love a food adventure when I can find one. I often have guilt or rationalizing attached to this, and I enjoy the things I want, but on specific schedules and around things where I have to be wary of how I look and feel in my body. I’m currently dealing with knowing that the holidays are here but I have an event on Sunday so I cannot actually indulge until Monday, and then I will have to be ready for another event that’s even higher pressure 2 weeks later. 

So, thus I have had a chronic eating disorder for over 20 years that did not develop from what I do (it started before), but is fed by it. It sits there, under the surface, ever present and I do make those choices to have the salad or steamed vegetables because first off, my income depends on my body looking a certain way, and secondly, I have attached some seriously negative thoughts and patterns to food. It has completely destroyed so many things for me, and it’s an ongoing, vicious cycle. I’ve been though treatment multiple times, and while I’ve had periods of greater or lesser severity, it’s always there. I expect that after 27 years, it will always be there. 

It pains me deeply how not alone I am in this.",kjqocu,ggyjolz,2020-12-25 03:37:30

In my early 20s, I had a boyfriend who loved to cook with me. We cooked at least one meal together nearly every day for almost 3 years. When he left my life, I sort of fell out of love with food. That was six years ago. I have yet to find my way back to a healthy relationship with food. It makes me angry, quite honestly. I am long since over that relationship, but I just cannot seem to reconnect with loving to cook or even loving food. I'm always trying though.

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing. I’ve never met a woman who doesn’t have a complicated relationship with food.”,"I had a boyfriend in whom I confided my battles with severe caloric restriction and mild anorexia. I used to starve myself in grad school because of a deep fear of gaining weight from having to be so sedentary. One night, during an argument, he said “you’ve gotten fat.”  

You see, I had just started a new job and the schedule didn’t let me work out and it was super high stress and I had put on about 5 pounds. The argument wasn’t even about weight or anything related...it was about taxes! I disagreed with something he said and he just went off on a tirade that ended with that gem of a sentence. 

The relationship is long gone and I am since happily married. However between being middle aged and COVID shutdowns I have gained some weight again, and I swear I keep on hearing his goddamn voice in the back of my head. I hate it!",kjqocu,ggyx9oa,2020-12-25 06:31:35

I developped disordered eating that I hid from everyone, but thoughts pertaining to food and weight dominated my life, every woman I would encounter, my brain would automatically assess their weight and make a comment like ""she is so skinny i am envious"", or ""i hope i am not as large as her"". Feelings of guilt and disgust were so dominant in my life for so many years around my food consumption. Only recently, i started to be ""food neutral"", as in enjoying and loving food without binging and also without feelings of guilt.

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing. I’ve never met a woman who doesn’t have a complicated relationship with food.”,"The first food and body related thing I remember in life is my mother angerly saying ""I can't lose weight if I eat."" I was maybe 10, but I remember it vividly. And that was it. She didn't ever teach me or my siblings anything about proper nutrition. She would rail on and on about GMOs being evil and how everything was going to give me cancer. So she would spend most of our food budget on expensive organic produce that she wouldn't ever cook and would then go bad, and my dad would spend the rest on junk food. 

My siblings and I all grew up obese. In high-school I started to fast all the time because I was so disgusted with my body and ""I cant lose weight if I eat"" was so ingrained in my brain. I started taking caffeine pills all the time to keep my energy up and curb my hunger. And then i would break and binge like crazy.. I dropped like 40-50lbs in a few months, then gained it back plus more,, and started the cycle over. Ive gotten better and worse a few times over the years. Theres not really a happy ending here. My image of myself is so distorted that I dont think I really know what I look like. Sometimes it feels like my body is just rapidly changing shape and size, even though I know its not. I don't know if I'll ever have a healthy relationship with food or my body. I highkey can't wait to just die so I can be done with all of this, I'm so tired of it.",kjqocu,ggykkem,2020-12-25 03:48:03

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing. I’ve never met a woman who doesn’t have a complicated relationship with food.”,"I’ve never had a complicated relationship with food 🤷‍♀️ Lord knows why that is, I suppose it must be at least in part with how I was raised (though my parents still did the “no no”s of forcing me to finish my plate, etc.) My mother never talked about her body though, and I was such a tomboy growing up I only cared about how strong I was or what sports I could play. 


It’s uncomfortable at times, I’ve been to group functions where the speaker will make some joke about how all of us women hate our thighs, for example, and everyone laughs while I’m sitting there like... I don’t though? I don’t calorie count, I don’t restrict myself, I’m active and I cook my own food, I eat sweets daily but perhaps my own frugality makes me budget out my treats because I don’t wanna have to go to the store to buy more constantly. 

The constant narrative that if you’re a woman you have to hate your body, or if you’re a thin woman you must hate your body and also starve yourself... I feel like in some cases it silences the voices of those who don’t fit that narrative. Which in turn makes that narrative louder. I’ll admit I would rarely feel comfortable saying “I like my body” to people I don’t know really well, because it would immediately be taken as a negative (bragging, self centred) instead of a positive (uh.. not hating myself.) It tends to drown out the opportunities for us to be proud of self acceptance, and instead echo the idea that self degradation is a trait of a *proper young lady.*",kjqocu,ggywimk,2020-12-25 06:20:37

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing. I’ve never met a woman who doesn’t have a complicated relationship with food.”,"I can't relate to this at all as a woman. I've never been compelled to diet, and I love loving food in a pretty healthy way. My body lets me know when I've eaten enough, if I need more salty food or veggies. Once I got fairly depressed and kinda stopped eating- for like half a day, then caved and ate some carrot sticks, and was back to eating normally the next day.

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing. I’ve never met a woman who doesn’t have a complicated relationship with food.”,"Woman here who got married 5 years ago at my normal weight. The women in my family pressured me to go for the traditional wedding dress, that's very expensive and you're tempted to buy at an ""aspirational"" size. Even the saleswoman remarked that almost everyone buys the dresses smaller than usual because they intend to lose weight. I found a dress that I didn't care much for but the people with me said I looked great, so I got it - in that aspirational size.

However I didn't lose weight because I like my body how it is. I then went through a whole process of getting the dress let out a size, and finally realized I actually hated the dress and was letting others' opinions get the best of me.

A couple months before my wedding I realized the kind of dress I wanted to get married in - dusty blue, no frills, and some sparkle because I've always loved silly sparkles. Found one that matched that description in the Nordstrom evening wear line, and wore it in my usual size on my wedding feeling beautiful and happy.

Madly trying to be a certain weight can't make you feel amazing like wearing what makes you happy can. I'll remember that dress forever. I've already forgotten what the first one even looked like.",kjqocu,ggyzlhr,2020-12-25 07:08:29

But because I was heavier than what I had aimed for. The year before, I worked out every morning, did weightlifting, and muscle replaced fat. I was the strongest I've ever been, but because I didn't understand CICO, I didn't lose weight.   
 I realized my worst fears on my wedding day where I weighed 10 lbs more than when I started trying to lose weight a year ago. A dress I loved before and had hoped to take in was a bit tight. I wore a corset underneath and fat rolls came over it in the back. I hated my dress. I hated my body. It was a beautiful wedding, everyone had a fantastic time but all I remember is loathing myself for not being skinnier. I still can't look at photos of myself at my own wedding, and it was 6 years ago.   

That is my biggest regret, for both getting too much into my head that I would let hating my body get in the way of happy memories of marrying my soul mate, while also hating myself for being a fat bride.",kjqocu,ggz8yj3,2020-12-25 10:09:44

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing. I’ve never met a woman who doesn’t have a complicated relationship with food.”,"I had just started middle school in the 7th grade and sat next to a cute guy in class that kept looking at me for the first few days. I got really excited thinking maybe he thinks I'm cute too? Then one day he says to me, in class, that I need to shave my legs. I was devastated, and went home after school crying to my mother about what he said. My Mom started taking me to wax appointments after that. Years later, I'm dating a guy in my early twenties. We're staring sweetly into each other's eyes, and he says to me ""you should pluck your eyebrows"". 

Eventually, I gave up on my looks altogether. My Mom was more critical of my looks than anyone else in my life. My aunt, my grandma, also pointed out my flaws and made me feel bad for not doing enough to fix them. I sometimes think I got fat on purpose as a fuck you to them and all the men that made me feel less than them, because I don't really want to look the way I used to.

She told me even though I was not overweight, I will probably never be skinny.

Log and weigh every bite for the rest of your life. 

If I just stopped at 80% or ""satisfied not full"" I'd be naturally at a healthy weight.  
  
If I went to therapy. Moved more. Ate less. CICO. Exercise more. Build muscle. Do cardio / don't do cardio... move more. Eat small meals 6 times / day. Eat one meal and fast in between. Make sure you have breakfast. Don't eat before 4pm. Eat more fat. Eat more carb. Eat more meat. Don't eat fat, carb, meat, sugar...

Love my body, accept my body no matter what. Even if that means being overweight or obsessive.

There is not one thing on this list that helped or worked like a GLP1.

I do feel cheated and unheard by the medical and weight-loss community. However, the professionals giving advice were using the best information they had at the time on how to treat obesity. Like many other treatments, their recommendations may not work, and it may come with harmful side effects. Now that these medications are available they are using the best information they have to provide the best care available. 

The part I struggle with today , and where I see gaslighting, is the professionals that ignore the information now that it is available, tested and proven to be significantly more successful, but they are choosing to continue to push “diet, exercise, and willpower” to overcome obesity.",1ijttfp,mbh1z7o,2025-02-07 13:20:36

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"I have found this to be true. I am an American who moved to the Netherlands. While I’m not arguing Europe is a magical weight loss drug, I have lost 96 pounds so far living here. For mostly the reasons you mentioned: food isn’t meant to be convenience. 

I definitely have to count my calories like everyone else here, but I have noticed differences when I go home to the US to visit. I’m shocked by how fast a meal in a restaurant is. I drive by fast food restaurants wherever I go. Here, they exist, but I would have to go out of my way to get to the McDonalds that’s near me. When I lived in America, the only road to my apartment had a row of fast food restaurants to drive by, thus necessitating the internal question of “should I just pick up a burger, or should I cook at home?” 

Restaurants give smaller portions, but even beyond that, DRINK portions are smaller. A weird adjustment I had to make was sitting through a (long!) european restaurant meal, and sipping my Diet Coke slowly. If you order one, you’re getting 12oz, and that’s it until your food arrives (at which point you can order another drink to have with the meal). I have a friend who calls America “The land of the free... ...refills”, and honestly, i think it’s really funny.  I do miss big drinks (and that sweet, sweet, free giant glass of water you can get in any American restaurant) next to your drink, if you want it. You can, of course, through some directed and specific questions to your server get free water here, but it’s a tiny glass (like, slightly larger than the size of a paper cup a hospital would give you to swallow a pill), and they are not going to be happy to keep refilling it. 

Over and above restaurants, one thing I really think helps with eating saner portions/having a healthier relationship to food, is how the grocery stores allow you to buy vegetables (etc) in normal quantities. Buying vegetables doesn’t have to be a 2 pound bag of lettuce that’s just going to rot and go bad. If you just need one carrot for the dish you’re making, you can buy a single carrot. My local grocery stores also make little ingredient boxes: want to make pea soup? Cool, here’s a box with peas, an onion, soup mix, and a few cloves of garlic. Interested in risotto? Same deal, there’s a box that has the chopped-up veggies you need, some rice, mushrooms, and a lil’ cheese. It’s genuinely awesome. There’s no comparison to American-style “cooking boxes” like Hamburger Helper (which is a box of pasta and various salt-based flavorings).

The differences between American and European food culture seem to me to be a macrocosm of the age-old dieter’s dilemma: do I want a LOT of something, or a small, VERY tasty  amount of it? America, in my experience, just blindly goes for quantity over quality. An American restaurant would be more likely give you a gigantic mixing bowl full of iceberg lettuce (because it looks huge and green) where a corresponding european restaurant salad would be much smaller—the size of an actual salad plate, but with an interesting medley of lettuces, and maybe some nuts/fruits/whatever studded throughout. 

I also think you pointed out another really important difference: price points. It is not appreciably cheaper here to make unhealthy, shelf-stable choices at the grocery store. Vegetables are affordable; you can buy them one at a time (no one is sending you home with 2 pounds of tomatoes when you just wanted to buy one to slice on top of your burger). Vegetarian meat substitutes are totally normal here, and, with some exceptions (imported things, like the impossible burger), are around the same price as their meat counterparts. I feel like in America making the commitment to eat healthy, fresh foods is also a commitment to shopping at Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, or whatever the upscale grocery store nearest you is. Sure, places like Walmart have vegetables, but they never look particularly fresh or end up being particularly good (source: did my groceries at a Walmart for many years before moving here). I often look at the Dutch versions of American people standing in the checkout lines, and am completely amazed. The tired construction worker, still in his high-viz is often buying the ingredients for a killer-looking spinach based pasta dish. That is to say, there appears to be a decoupling between the American attitude of “big tough men gotta eat big tough things” and the associated piles of frozen sausage biscuits and bags of Doritos at the checkout counter. People here, of all walks of life and gender, make more reasonable food decisions. Maybe it’s cultural, maybe it’s Maybelline. Who knows. 

All of that is not to say that the Dutch are perfect paragons of health. Their national breakfast food is chocolate sprinkles on top of buttered bread (hagelslag, yo). They have some places, especially around train stations, where it’s easy to find and buy the convenience-food eat-as-you-walk stuff. Every city has at least one “wall” of fried snacks, which works kind of like a vending machine: you put a euro in and get a stick of deep fried gravy (or, as the Dutch would call it “a kroket”). But I think the difference here is you just get one, and that seems to be enough for people. I’ve done the calorie counting, and eaten my share of wall-kroketjes. They’re like 250 calories. The American Value Version(TM) would be giving you 3 kroketten, a side of fries, and half a liter of coke. 

Anyway, this is getting long. But I have experienced this first hand, and I think moving here is how I was able to reverse a lifetime of obesity. To all my American friends still out there, figuring out wtf to do with the 2 pound bag of carrots you needed to buy, just because you wanted to add some julienned carrots to your salad at lunch, I see you, and I am impressed with your creative meal-preps to use up those ingredients. You’re fighting the good, fight, and I am proud of you. 

And, to all the Europeans who are reading this, who struggle with their weight, I see you too. Even if the portions are smaller, it is SO easy to eat a few hundred calories more than you should in a day. It’s easy to gain a little weight. And I know you’re all logging and keeping up the good fight too. I am proud of you, too. 

Anyway, I’m going to end this ramble here. I’m happy to answer questions about American/European food culture, to the best of my ability.",drvyh0,f6lffx4,2019-11-05 08:19:09
[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,[deleted],drvyh0,f6lsfli,2019-11-05 13:10:59
[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"I think this is super interesting because I've never been to the U.S. (in Northern Europe myself) and I don't always understand the whole picture. So this post will probably negate all my ""good advice"" now lol!

&nbsp;

For me it's totally natural that 

* I rarely eat in restaurants, 

    because it's super expensive to eat out, and it takes a long time to go there, sit and wait for the food to arrive (maybe half an hour of sitting down and talking), you don't really get that much food anyway but it costs 10 times as much as cooking at home in a fraction of the time.

* I rarely eat at fast food restaurants.

    because there are none in the town centre anyway, and definitely none in the village where I live. There is one McDonalds and one Burger King in town, but they are pretty far away from the center of town next to a supermarket / near the main road. Also their food isn't very tasty, yuk. I'm used to fresh food.

* I rarely buy premade foods or frozen meals.

    because as you say, 80% of the store is ingredients for meals. And the premade foods taste bad.

    Premade foods have increased though. I've seen these silly things in the store, like ""pizza kits"", it's a premade dough, already rolled out... and a pouch of oily, weird tomato sauce. I got some for free and tried it and the dough tasted terrible. I had to cover it with loads of toppings and cheese to hide the dough flavor. *Why?*

    When I make pizza, I pour some water in a bowl, add yeast, salt, oil and flour, knead it, and wait for 30 minutes. I don't usually buy it anywhere because the pizzas you buy just don't taste very good. Hence I don't eat pizza super often either.

* I eat a lot of vegetables and fruit.

    There are lots of fresh ingredients in stores and it's usually the first thing you see when you enter the store. In our local store the vegetables and fruit are right inside the door. Everyone needs to get their potatoes and onions and other staples so...

* I use my bike to go to the store.

    I could drive, but we only have one car and I don't usually drive it much. I'll take the train, bus, bike, or walk where I am going. Taking the car just feels like a hassle, you have to park it and all that kind of stuff lol. You can take your bike on the train if need be.

&nbsp;

This isn't because I'm super healthy, it's mostly because of how society is here. I might be eating less premade foods because I like cooking and try to keep it healthy, and don't live in a big city with access to a lot of convenience food.

&nbsp;

Eating *while* driving seems insane and dangerous, eating food *while* working seems like you can't enjoy the food. Idk. I prefer to eat and enjoy, then do something else.

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"> DRINK portions are smaller.

This reminded me, I like to watch Twitch streams sometimes. The first time I saw someone drinking (coke or something) I stared at it - it was like he was drinking it from a bucket. It looked so ridiculously oversized. I wondered how his bladder could even hold all of that.

&nbsp;

>And, to all the Europeans who are reading this, who struggle with their weight, I see you too. Even if the portions are smaller, it is SO easy to eat a few hundred calories more than you should in a day. It’s easy to gain a little weight.

When I reflect on it - I have no idea why / how I was overweight in the first place.

But ... I am short, my TDEE is low. I was never active in the past. I liked to eat sweets. Baked goods with coffee, not just one. Bake and eat all of it over a few days. Use cream in homemade food. Eat too much of it.

If I had grown up like many others here, I would probably have ballooned up to 400 lbs minimum with my old ways - here I reached about 90 kg. Still almost twice as big as I needed to be. I know people who are 100-160 kg.

&nbsp;

It's possible to get fat anywhere, but you have to be pretty dedicated to become 600 lbs around here. That would be a feat. :P

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"This is very interesting. I live in the Netherlands (am Dutch), and when I first read this post I thought the differences OP describes are merely the differences between city life and more rural life. I live in a smaller town, and definitely drive almost everywhere (because screw biking or walking long distances in this weather). But now that I read your post, I realized it IS very different here than in the US. I've lived in the US, so I should be able to make the comparison myself... Apparently not lol. And while I definitely do Amercan things like driving and eating fast food, it is still not the same. Your comments about restaurants and grocery stores are spot on. It is true that a cheap grocery store like Lidl has an amazing produce section here, and healthy food is very affordable.

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"It’s so easy to become overweight. That’s been the big lesson I’ve been learning all along. Unlike some of the folks here struggling with binging, that was never me. I just ate a little too much for too long, and it all added up. Now that I have been eating a little less for a long time, it has added up too. There are fat people here in Europe (though fewer than in America), and I don’t judge them harshly. Inactivity and too much cream in your coffee adds up, no matter what color your passport is. 

I often wonder if I would have been as big as I was (127kg at the highest) if I grew up here in Europe, and I don’t think I would have. I mean, I am aware it’s an impossible comparison— there are way too many variables. But, I am seeing that “bigger is better” was a very location-dependent concept. And that living in a healthier (well, a less obviously overweight one, at least) society was enough to get me to at least be willing to try to change. I’m just a normal person at the end of the day: I want to fit in, and feel like I belong. And feeling like I fit in was not possible at the weight I was at. I still don’t feel like I fit in, but I do know I’m making progress. And yeah, weight loss has helped, but so has time, and language-learning, and good ol’ experience of just living here.",drvyh0,f6lif8k,2019-11-05 09:39:32

And... these excuses aren’t real. They feel totally real but what they actually are is a way to trying to reconcile the cognitive dissonance in my head because I KNOW that eating this particular thing in this quantity is... not good for me. Not because any food is “bad” as such, but for the reasons I was eating them: to cope.

American advertising normalizes an abnormally unhealthy relationship with food.,"Same goes for alcohol. I recently saw an add for ""portable premium cocktails"" to ""take on your next adventure""...as if hiking in the woods is something you should be doing while chugging canned margaritas. The idea of being active and then drinking alcohol as a ""reward"" is so common and so normalized by advertisements. When I first started going to the gym I would drink hard ciders right after and basically cancel out any benefits with a bunch of sugary alcohol that dehydrated me, made my sleep patterns hell, and kept me from losing weight.

The thing is most people would say either with the Reeses or the cocktails that it's puritanical to deny yourself the ""reward"" sometimes but there's just way too much of it out there. You can get candy, chips, fast food, flavored coffee, beer etc etc every two steps in a major city and even outside that there's always delivery or Amazon.  

I think once you start being more aware your choices are less zombie-fied and more drawn to choose what your body needs to feel good.

I have kids. I have ice cream or candy when they are asleep even though it's forbidden for them, especially in the evenings. And yes, they walked on me eating more than once. 

Rules for kids are not rules for adults, simple as. Do the kid ask to drink coffee or wine? Can the kid watch TV before bedtime? Can she stay awake later at night? I don't think so. You can easily teach your children that no, they are not your equals and that rules for them don't necessarily apply to you. 

Once they are your age they can decide to eat ice cream and candy and even fries every meal if they so chose. But for now, they are growing up, sugar is not healthy for a growing body, and her parents are responsible for her health. When she's older she'll be responsible for her own health and then and only then will she be able to do unhealthy choices for herself. 

Anyway, it's a parenting failure of your brother and SIL, and I'd be tempted to ask them to find somewhere else to live if they can't be respectful.",1kxi2yw,mupeyrz,2025-05-28 14:30:31

It's easier for the parents to make the OP change their daily habits than to admit that they are making the rules for their child and as an adult OP makes their own rules.

I'm also not sure why the brother and his family are staying with OP, but if it's because they need a place to stay: is this really worth risking their temporary housing over?

Does anyone else feel like calorie counting messed up their relationship with food?,"Yes, this was my experience. Through calorie counting I was able to lose about 30lbs in just over half a year which got me down to a healthy BMI, however, it became an obsession and all I could think about. 


By the end it practically led me into eating disorder territory, and then after I realised I had to stop for my mental health, all of the weight piled back on in less than a year - I realised I hadn't actually *learned* anything about how to eat normally, how to eyeball portions, how to listen to my body's signals etc, because I had been 100% relying on the calculator to make all my decisions for me. 


Stupidly, this wasn't enough of a cue for me to realise calorie counting wasn't right for me - so I tried again a couple years later. I thought this time I'll pay more attention to my body, portions etc so that I actually learn useful skills. But it didn't happen like that. Again, I lost all the weight, again it became an obsession verging on an ED, and again I put all of the weight back on immediately after I had to stop counting. 



For me personally, the only solution was to seek other methods of weight loss that didn't involve calorie counting. I am happy to say that in 2022 I lost all the weight again, this time without calorie counting, it was much easier on my mental health and it's been 3 years and I haven't put it back on. 


I didn't follow any specific diet or plan etc. I just focused on trying to eat as many vegetables as possible, and limiting calorific drinks and calorie dense foods (but without counting/measuring - just making swaps eg eating fruit for a snack instead of chips, swapping full fat mayo for light mayo and consciously using less of it). ",1m3t1qz,n3z8cv2,2025-07-19 11:24:31

Counting calories can be hard, but for me, being unhappy in an overweight body was much harder. Because I thought about my weight EVERY day. It upset me every single day. Now it doesn’t.",1m3t1qz,n3z6wne,2025-07-19 11:13:16

AITA for “forcing” my wife to eat,"Hi OP:

I'm being vulnerable when I say this so people try to be kind. I've never admitted to having an ED, but I'm not stupid. I know I have some kind of issue surrounding eating/ morphed view on it. I'm not proud of it and know better.

Your wife sounds similar to me, even around the same age I'm 30. She knows what she is doing and is doing it both consciously and subconsciously. I can't tell you why she is doing it, everyone has their own ""issue""/ reason for starting this vicious cycle. Personally for me, mine started with my depression. It gave me no desire to eat, food had no taste, appetite or take care of myself in general. Once I got my depression kind of under control, I still deal with it, it was kind of like my food issue was now ""set in stone"". I put quotes around it because of course it's not, I'm the one still making it like that. 

You're NTA for ""forcing"" her to eat but it's not going to work. She on her own needs to make the choice and decision that SHE WANTS to change and help herself. I know that's really upsetting and painful to hear, but it's the truth. 

The more you push, the more you "" force"" .... The more secretive and hard she is going to work to hide the food from you , skip even more meals/ the small snacks she is actually eating, or run four hours instead of three.

I'm not saying you should pretend like nothing is happening or say absolutely nothing, that would be neglectful and uncaring. It's a hard spot understand...I mean my boyfriend would definitely understand what you are going through. He definitely knows I have some kind of disordered eating and struggles with it and tries his damn best to be helpful and supportive without being overbearing and pushy. He's amazing at it and I love him dearly for it. But I know at the beginning I was snarky and defensive about his subtle ways of trying to help. 

Some ways subtle ways he helps: 

1. He makes dinner for himself but will make me a plate and say "" I made you a plate for whenever you want it"" - takes the pressure off of feeling like I have to eat right then and there or you will be offended otherwise. It also takes away the pressure of having to eat in front of someone, giving the trust of "" I know you'll eat it at some point""
2. The plate he puts my food on is never this giant ass massive plate. It's a smaller sized plate- this takes away the immediate feeling I get of looking at food and feeling like "" that's a lot I can't eat all of that no way I'm finishing that plate""
3. Never comments or praises me for eating or finishing something, basically pretends like I didn't even eat- again takes away the pressure of feeling like someone is watching you eat and monitoring your every move. 
4. Never asks "" are you hungry?"" Or "" are you sure you aren't hungry?""- this will quite literally make me not eat longer
5. This one will seem silly or counterintuitive but... He will always ask do you want to go out to eat? I usually will say no and I bet your wife would as well. He will just say ok see you later. And he will go out by himself and get food, he rarely has left overs as he has an amazing appetite 🤣 but if he does they go in the fridge. Those leftovers can start looking prettttttyyyyyyy gooood sometimes. And also, it started to get lonely sitting there knowing he is out having a good time. So guess what ? I started joining him even if I didn't eat. That's a big step to be surrounded by all that food and not get crazy anxious.

I know some people will think he's babying me or going above and beyond but he's not. He literally just does it out of the kindness of his heart, and isn't annoyed in any way shape or form. He has helped me improve slowly but surely. And like I said I'm aware I have a problem and am not proud.

But you mentioned she said she would like to go to restaurants occasionally as a hobby, perhaps you might have better luck getting her to eat if you pick her up her favorite takeout.

AITA for “forcing” my wife to eat,"Just in case no one else has pointed this out, anorexia comes in all shapes and sizes. Just because a person isn't skin and bones doesn't mean they don't have it. Also eating disorders, as far as I'm aware, usually stem from a desire to control something in life. Life tends toward chaos, so controlling the consumption of food can be a surrogate for some other area of life which seems overwhelming.

AITA for “forcing” my wife to eat,"I have struggled with disordered eating my whole life, she has something going on.

I'm short and somehow when I am hovering around 130 people start to get concerned about my weight. 120 I look almost skeletal. So regardless of being in a healthy weight range, my brain is getting the good feels it wants because you can see my bones. To maintain that weight I have to eat like 500 calories a day AT MOST and exercise for hours a day. That's clearly not healthy and after about 8 months of that I get sick and crash out.

AITA for “forcing” my wife to eat,"Glennon Doyle has spoken about having an eating disorder so there may be some insight there.

I can’t imagine how difficult it will be but you’ve got to pretend that there’s nothing wrong (to a point). The more you push the harder she’ll resist. You’ve got to treat food as something necessary but not to be dwelled on, like brushing your teeth.

The end point is if she faints, or injures herself. That’s not normal and the ER may be necessary. 

It might work after a bit to try asking her to come sit with you while you eat so that you’re not alone, or while running errands on a Saturday, go to lunch. Tell her it’s fine if she’s not hungry, but you need to eat. If she doesn’t want to order anything, let it go. In my experience, don’t go somewhere like Five Guy’s. The intense meat/fat smell can be overwhelming. 

If you are a person who snacks, make a plate of healthy, nutrient dense snacks and put it in the refrigerator. She may slowly start to eat some off the plate or out of the container if it’s not easy for you to monitor it, or the container is big enough she wouldn’t eat all of it, which could be triggering. That way she’s getting some nutrition while you work on the mental health aspect. Examples: hummus, cheese, fruit and vegetables, chicken, nuts, whole grain crackers, turkey, yogurt and/or cottage cheese dips, whatever other healthy foods y’all like. 

I have major depression and the chaos in the world right now has exacerbated my issue. This is just to say that she may have had a more recent trigger that is causing whatever healthy control she had over her past issues to fail. Also, are there activities y’all enjoy that are outdoors or that keep you both off your phones?",1mewjek,n6dgjv8,2025-08-01 16:16:37

Anorexia is ultimately about control - you control your food and your body because either everything else around you feels uncontrollable and chaotic or because you’re trying to reclaim the autonomy that was taken from you, such as in the case of sexual assault. 

You’re in a difficult position, but forcing your wife to eat or get on the scale is only reaffirming her lack of autonomy. Be supportive, but always reassure her that it’s her choice - don’t force her ever. Give her options - would you like to eat an apple or a banana? No? Okay, maybe later.

Every once in a while, she would fuck up and tell the story in a way that clued him in that she was lying, or there would be some evidence, or I would be so upset that he honestly didn’t care if I had really done what she said I did to deserve her wrath.

On those occasions, dad would “help” by getting me out of the house. We would get in the car and go for a drive. Inevitably, we would end up at the grocery store bakery, where we would pick a package of something sweet and indulgent, which we would eat in the car. The packaging was discarded and our hands and faces were wiped before we went home. It was our little secret.

Anyone else have messed up relationships with food now?,"Your parents sound so much like my own... my dad did his best to make things better for us kids, and at the time he was our hero because she always stopped the abuse when he came home from work. 

At mealtimes my mum would sit opposite us, scrutinising our every movement and criticising the way we held our cutlery/chewed our food etc etc in her angry booming voice. I used to end every mealtime shaking like a leaf. 

But now as an adult I wonder why the hell he didn't stand up to her... he would come home to find us cowering in a corner of our ransacked bedroom with swollen red marks on our faces arms and legs... and she'd give him some lame excuse that we had been disobedient. He would then say 'I'll get them out from under your feet' and take us out for a few hours, usually involving something nice to eat in the car and then like you, hiding the evidence. 

So concequently as an adult I feel uncomfortable eating in front of people, especially if they're not eating themselves. In these situations I still find my hands shaking. I prefer to eat in private, usually stuffing my face as quick as I can.

I have done so much over my adult years to heal my wounds and discover the 'me' beneath the trauma but the eating thing is one of those residual reminders that I can't seem to shake. I've just lived with it because it's no where near as destructive as the other issues I had. You said in your post that you are a recovering compulsive eater... can I ask how you managed that?

Once I realized he knew about the abuse and chose to do nothing, it still took a while to process (because how could I have 2 parents that didn't love me or even care enough to protect us?)

Now I know he was as guilty as she was. And he is just a wimp that doesn't stand up to anyone. UGH

Other agents let us know that Lindsay called them after work on those days and asked if they wanted to go shopping. We were told Lindsay was abusing medications, possibly to get out of work, possibly because she and her boyfriend were known drug users.

Then Lindsay had to pay for the ambulance rides, in order for our health insurance to cover them. She was out a signficant amount of money until she was reimbursed.

She would go home on the first day of her period, because she ""forgot"" when her cycle started and ""made a mess"".

The most interesting thing about Adult Misty as a character is her relationship with food.,"Each character as an adult has incredibly interesting relationships with food. 
Shauna has made it an inseparable aspect of her identity, she is the one who prepares the meals in her home much the same way she was the only one to butcher in the wilderness. She has an affinity for it.
Tai has become afraid of food, self harming by satiating with Caffeine which eventually leads to huge crash outs in which her alternate personality taking control to give her “what she needs”
Misty not only eats indiscriminately but she hoards food when she thinks it’s threatened. She doesn’t want to be starving again 
Lottie treats food as “holy” or magical, it has a function, and each function is to treat something which she feels is lacking in her own body.
We don’t inherently see Van interacting with food, however we do see her interact with alcohol, yet again perhaps a form of self harming, especially in the face of her cancer diagnosis. 
Nat, we know eats candy, sugar, chocolate, i think because this is some of the only stuff she can stomach. It isn’t a living being, it didn’t need to die for her to gain sustenance, I don’t even remember her eating during her dinner with Kevyn in season one.

The most interesting thing about Adult Misty as a character is her relationship with food.,"This comment got me thinking -- it's actually really interesting that Shauna is often seen in the kitchen in the scenes with her family. Perhaps, because of her role as the butcher, Shauna feels that her usefulness is primarily as a cook/butcher at home as well. This may be augmented because she also lacks the ability, at least early on, to connect emotionally with her daughter and her husband. Hence, her conversation in season 1 with Callie when she asks to have a meaningful conversation and immediately launches into how she is making meatloaf, which Callie sees as rudimentary, but to Shauna this ability is what makes her useful and thus brings meaning to her life. This is especially so because being a stay-at-home mom is not how she pictured her life would play out before the plane crash. She had great aspirations that she was never able to attain because of the crash and her subsequent choices. One of the only ways she can feel a sense of achievement is through this role as the cook for her family. This speaks not just to how she feels can be of use within her family but also touches on how she was able to find meaning and survive in her role as the butcher/cook in wilderness. In that sense, she has not changed. She still strives to be needed. Ergo, her adititude in the wilderness, her skepticism but ultimate loyalty towards the wilderness worship, her anger towards Nat for being named as the leader, her vindictive affair with Adam, and her behavior towards her daughter. Kind of a side tangent, but in that way, I think her need to be needed is actually very similar to Misty and I see the comparisons between them and their (albeit very different) psychopathic tendencies as well.",1h297d0,lziwp1m,2024-11-29 06:31:37

People contain multitudes. It's why something like introversion or extroversion isn't a direct link to how social someone *wishes* to be. Or how someone like Mitch Hedberg might do stand up while not making eye contact. Or how OOP might have truly damaged some relationships in her time, but seems to be on a path of genuine care and repair.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"My 2 cents. I believe her when she says shes a narcissist. You see I was born without being able to feel hungry. How can that possibly relate? Because we're both kind of trying to emulate what everyone else does just on hardwired instinct. I never felt hungry until I was 10 or 11. My hunger isn't the same as yours. It's very time based and if I ignore it for 30.minutes or an hour then it goes away. In college o got wrapped up in other things I forgot to eat for 3 days. My freshman 15 was losing 15 pounds lol... Which honestly wasn't healthy either. 


But my point is if you didn't know me you'd probably never know. But if you hung out with me and were really observant, you could pick up those unauthentic vibes. The manufacture signs. The motions I go through because it's what I've learned I should be doing. It just doesn't feel quite right. 


And her whole post just feels that way. Narcissists make everything about them. As she did through this whole post. She also says she feels like she's the best at everything. Yep I picked up on that just reading the post. The best ideas, always right on her feelings and desires. And I'm not saying she's wrong. I'm saying she's working really hard at masking but it's got that tinge of unauthenticness to it. A flavor I'm very familiar with. At the end of the day though, I believe strongly in judging a person based on their actions and not their intentions. So regardless of why she's doing these things, they're good things to do and I'm giving her credit where it is due.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"A realization that I came to within the last year was that NPD is one of the last mental health issues that is freely stigmatized and used to shit on other people. It's the last bastion of unopposed armchair diagnosis. You don't like somebody? They're a narcissist. Someone does something shitty? They're a narcissist. You don't agree with a random person /politician/ celebrity? Narcissist. 

It's incredible to me that people can be so soft and kind about so many mental health diagnoses these days but narcissists? Absolutely not, k!ll 'em with fire, you know? As if it isn't a legitimate mental health diagnosis that impacts people's lives in countless ways. It's like it isn't pretty enough for people to be nice. It isn't popular enough to feel compassion  for those who have it as an actual mental health issue for people to care. It's the medieval leper of mental illnesses. I get it. I've been in a relationship with someone who is diagnosed as a narcissist by multiple mental health care professionals. And he was absolutely the most abusive person I've ever met in my life. Completely different than OOP in his actions and life. He can twist people so, so easily and he absolutely adores any and all eyes on him. And he's in therapy! His therapist is one of the people he manipulates the most easily. He is an incredibly charming monster. OOP isn't. Mental health diagnoses are not a monolith. Maybe if my ex had had the kind of foresight and help that OOP has then he would have turned out more like that.

Reading from the perspective of someone who has a diagnosis of NPD and seeing everything that they've done with their life to live within the bounds of that mental health issue is fascinating. Especially knowing that they are drawn to others with the same diagnosis just like every other mental health issue. We seek out a community of people who understand us. It's basic human nature. They have built an entire life for themselves that facilitates their mental health diagnosis while minimizing the impact that diagnosis has on the entire rest of the world who isn't like them. It's commendable.

I was on the periphery of a friend group like this for several months. The men all vied for the “alpha” position until the top dog (the richest, most narcissistic) was chosen. He was then careful to regularly spotlight the achievements of the other guys to avoid a mutiny. Most of the group’s activities were centered around his interests, appetites and whims. The women were entirely fabulous all the time, with most conversations revolving around praiseworthy appearances, talents or experiences.

It felt like visiting a bizarre Instagram reality with the Real Housewives. We constantly went to fancy dinners, parties, and important events. It was front row tickets, restaurant openings or theme nights every weekend. When our group was at events, we regularly got applause. Even camping was a fashion show and gear expo, with the men performing impressive feats of strength for crowds. 

But they also did karaoke with a full sound system in a crowded campground until 1am, and thought it was HILARIOUS. At restaurants, they’d assume everyone there wanted to hear their conversations. Other patrons complained and they thought it was funny. Every person in the group was randomly either exactly on time or at least 90 minutes late with zero explanation. They were verbally abusive to their children. I could go on and on. Alcohol gave them an excuse to be audacious/vulgar in public places. But they were beautiful and rich, and there never seemed to be any real consequences. Their behavior was often embarrassing, but I think they were incapable of feeling embarrassed.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding?

And in an attempt to make it up to her OOP whoa lready struggles with knowing what is appropriate and what not, let it go on. So while it seems weird from the outside and is definitely unhealthy, neither of them could realise it by themselfes.

But I think the biggest problem are the parents. It seems the dad always enabled OOP as a child and the mom is then enabling the sister. They both contributed to the issues the sisters have.

And the sister's therapist also seem to be a problem as OOP says the therapist ""helped with setting those boundaries"" - if that is true, the therapist enabled the sister to be controlling to ounish the OOP. Which to me means the therapist likely has a bad opinion on people with NPD and is therefore not the right fit.",1hzfadq,m6q3o5b,2025-01-12 10:18:40

My grandmother and her second husband had a great marriage. He was also a narcissist. They enabled each other. It’s like the OOP said about her husband, they basically view each other as extensions of themselves. They are The Best, so obviously they deserve to be with someone who is also The Best. It’s not competing for the center of attention if you view the other person getting attention as you also having the spotlight through marriage. My grandmother and her husband were both fairly successful creatives, and they genuinely viewed each others accomplishments as their own. 

My uncle, on the other hand, has never had a successful relationship. He’s had a lot of very short flings where she ended it early because he’s insufferable. He’s also had a couple of two-three year relationships where he ended it. In those longer relationships, they were always people pleasers who worshipped him and he got bored and started to look down on her. If he is The Best, he should be with The Best. An insecure people pleaser is not The Best. 

It’s taken my years of therapy and coming to terms with who the people in my family are, but they aren’t inherently evil. They just have broken brains that make them very difficult to be around. I strongly dislike my uncle, but I respect that he has always ended a relationship when he starts to look down on her instead of staying and getting mean (like my grandmother did with her first husband) and I respect now that in his 60s he’s decided to just stay single and do his own thing instead of inflicting himself on more unsuspecting women.

The takeaway I from their family dynamic is that the parents indulged and fostered OP's narcissism as she was growing up and neglected the sister and enabled the abuse.


After getting diagnosed and working on improving, OP forced her parents to confront their own role.


This sentence stood out to me
> My mom is very strict though, and says that the boundaries are important and that I abused my sister when we were growing up by stealing attention, so her and her trauma is the most important thing.


The mom isn't taking any responsibility for the sister's shitty childhood and seems to have decided that the only ""fair"" way to handle things is to swap which sibling gets to be the golden child.


The dad seems to realize that abusing OP doesn't actually make up for the sister being abused/neglected as a child.


Again, I'm certainly not an expert, but I would imagine a much healthier boundary would be to let OP talk about her accomplishments, but tell her that she has to drop it and change the subject if she's asked to, rather than just outright forbidding that she can ever say anything about anything she's done.",1hzfadq,m6rvtah,2025-01-12 17:30:40

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"I have BPD I am very aware of the idea that they are ""incurable"" I seek remission so much because fuck this ""personality"". I'm very aware of how effective DBT can be having done it once and I wish to do it again.

I can imagine that in every single interaction of their lives, OOP took the spotlight and did it with such confidence that it destroyed her sister's self-esteem.

If you have a sibling who is close to you in age, you know how toxic a bad relationship can be. There is no escape.",1hzfadq,m6pwgxw,2025-01-12 09:02:37
AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"It's really hard to judge from just OOP's perspective, though. Like, for a typical person, it *is* normal to talk about yourself.

But OOP literally has a comment mentioning that when she ""talks about herself"", that can be a four-hour-long monologue. Or perhaps talking intensely and sincerely about how much better she is at everything than anyone else.

OOP has gotten some therapy; it sounds like she's made progress. But she's still openly participating in some of those really extreme NPD behaviours. Can she talk about herself in a way that isn't going to be nails-on-a-chalkboard to someone she's hurt that way?

Like, I have a relative who is definitely not NPD, but has that habit of ""topping"" anything you tell him about yourself. And honestly, I don't talk to him anymore, because that one feature (which is way less extreme than what OOP is describing) makes having a ""normal"" conversation with him *impossible*.",1hzfadq,m6plwav,2025-01-12 07:13:05
AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"I thought that, too. A blonde popular beauty queen soprano witch with brautiful dresses and dancing and being the good all-beloved center-of-attention person sounds like OOPs dream. Ofc OOP would think that people would be way more interested in and relate way more to Glinda than Elphaba. After all, Glinda also thinks she deserves the solo lessons and is disliking Elphaba for being better and getting any attention at all (at first). Having the perspective of realising that and changing ways and becoming friends with the poor unpopular person and being better and still the most beloved one is similar to OP getting diagnosed and understanding the hurt she caused and changing her ways to not hurt anymore (but still wanting all the attention and feeling like she is better than everyone).",1hzfadq,m6qi799,2025-01-12 12:41:32

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"Sorry, my communication is sometimes a bit unclear. I was referring to the same thing, just trying to add a bit of extra context. I was saying that, because in expert fields it is *still* a contentious issue whether or not incurability means ""not worth the effort"", that ideology has spread through mainstream conversations. The conversations OOP was having in the comments are so similar to the experiences of PD service users in the texts I am reading. 


It is very frustrating to see where it comes from. Especially considering that patients with PDs, like OOP and yourself, have their own goals for what recovery looks like (and often very good ideas!) that are ignored by clinicians as well as family because ""you won't be *cured*"". As if a total absence of symptoms was the only kind of improvement.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"It really is. I see the same mindset with ADHD (""why be reliant on meds your whole life, just tough it out or wait for a cure""), but that's mainly receded into antimedical lay culture. The way the same attitude to PDs (""why waste resources on therapy if you can't meet our standard of a cure?"") or to mental illness in disabled folk (""why medicate depression if you're not productive anyway?"") still shows up in professional settings is disturbing.

CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,"All of your downsides come down to the idea that there is more food on the kids plate than it would be healthy for the kid to eat.  
In order to solve this problem there is your options are throwing away a bunch of food or to let the kid have input on how big of a portion to serve.  
I dont see a reason to choose to throw away food instead of giving the kid some autonomy on what he wants on his plate. 
As for the autonomy option there are a few upsides:  
Its far easier to get a kid to try new things by telling them to finish what is on their plate and putting only a bite sized portion of a new food on their plate.  
The kid learns to take responsibility for their decisions.  
Its easy to treat everyone at the table equal as you would let yourself and your partner decide how much you want to eat anyways.",hxjkfp,fz6qllo,2020-07-25 11:08:52
CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,"Disagree completely. First of all, children, let's say at the ages of 3 to 5 specifically, don't have a mature relationship with ""hunger"".  They will eat when they aren't hungry and they will not eat, when they *are* hungry. Do you know why? Because they want sweets. 

This craving is completely natural, in fact at that age they don't even have a ""too sweet, too much sugar"" off switch.  

As a parent, your duty is to prepare your children for the world. Part of this includes feeding them a healthy diet which includes vegetables and other whole non-processed foods that aren't loaded with sugar. 

When they don't want to eat these foods, despite being hungry, this is where the parent has to explain that they have to eat these foods. Eventually, the children will become familiar with whole foods and vegetables that may be bitter.  They will carry this into adulthood, and their bodies will thank you.",hxjkfp,fz6mamo,2020-07-25 09:54:41

.....

I'm the person who recommended this series of posts.

Before I begin with to share my thoughts, I want to thank /u/LucyAriaRose for considering my recommendation and for their contributions to this subreddit. Kudos to you for your hard work.

This is a condition that has interested me even before my journey to become a physician because I had colleagues and friends who were victims and I was powerless to support them. Eating disorders also overlap greatly with many social determinants of health, such as income, social inclusion, mental health, substance use, and is impacted by many elements within society that makes it interesting to study. The consequences are also profound and leaves a devastating trail of broken families in its wake. I hope that people get the opportunity to educate themselves more about this condition so that they recognize the signs either within themselves or others. It's important to bring up these sensitive issues in a discreet and tactful way. You may be able to save a life armed with important knowledge and awareness of eating disorders and I hope that this story, and my post, is educational for you.

I am Canadian but the US data and resources are just as useful.

Eating disorders (EDs) are behavioral conditions characterized by severe and persistent disturbance in eating behaviors, affecting physical, psychological, and social functions. The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder in America is 0.6%, 0.3% and 1.2% respectively. It should be noted that this is likely an underestimation, especially given the significant stigma associated with mental illness, combined with the additional stigma of eating disorders. Females are typically many times more likely to develop eating disorders than males. It's also important to consider that many eating disorders were not even considered diagnoses until after 1979, and measurements for these figures may be variable.

The stigma around eating disorders are profound and the evidence is strong for all forms of eating disorder. People have a perception that victims of eating disorders are personally responsible for causing their disorder. People think that victims often lack self discipline (""just eat more""). Some people believe victims of eating disorders are attention seeking, either wanting attention to their ""beauty"" or ""trauma.""

Unfortunately in society, obese and overweight people tend to be perceived as less valuable to society. This is seen even in children, who are more likely to prefer photos of normal weight appearing children compared to overweight children. Eating disorders are most common among female adolescents and are often considered the most impressionable, combined with being the most vulnerable. Interestingly, eating disorders are also described as a disease of the affluent, where those in higher socioeconomic status being more likely to develop anorexia and bulimia. This may be due to the importance placed on public perceptions. It's also important to consider the impact of the ""ideal body"" on development of eating disorders. In particular, the ideal female figure has significantly changed in the 20th century, with marked decreases in size. The female internalization of the ""ideal thin beauty"" increases risk for eating disorders significantly.

Other risk factors include adversity during childhood, being transgender, concurrent mental health diagnosis, I have heard of people mentioning that being underweight is a risk factor for anorexia... but it is unclear if that is a cause or effect... for example, people with anorexia are inherently underweight as a part of the diagnosis.

The medical complications of eating disorders is miles long affecting tons of organ systems.

Management is incredibly complex, but it really requires support both from family and professionals. Some may need hospital admission in order to stabilize their condition medically. The mainstay treatment involves psychotherapy (CBT, motivational interviewing, family therapy, etc) and nutritional rehabilitation. It's important to consider refeeding syndrome among those that eat too quickly. Pharmacotherapy is NOT the mainstay treatment, but it is often aimed at weight gain as well as addressing ancillary mood concerns (such as depression or anxiety). Antipsychotics like olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole have been documented, but there is a paucity of randomized control trials and the evidence for their use is questionable. Only olanzapine has been seem to have some potential benefits.

Lastly, remember the SCOFF acronym ... as this is commonly used in primary care as a basic screen for people with increased risk for eating disorders. Ask yourself these questions and answer them honestly.

Do you make yourself Sick because you feel uncomfortably full?

Do you worry you have lost Control over how much you eat?

Have you recently lost more than One stone (14 pounds or 6.35 kg) in a three-month period?

Do you believe yourself to be Fat when others say you are too thin?

Would you say that Food dominates your life?

A final note... eating disorders are very serious, but there are ways to manage and live with the condition. Don't give up hope. Love yourself and each other. Let's focus on reducing the stigma and support uplifting our bodies.

If you have other questions in the future, I'd be happy to help within reason (if I'm not busy seeing patients) or visit us on the /r/askdocs subreddit.

Take care,

It’s hard to explain. It feels like OOP is heading down a similar route - she’s so terrified of developing anorexia that she’s spiralling. Poor sweet thing, I hope one of those parents can get their shit together and get that kid in therapy",1gx0w53,lydmcvn,2024-11-22 06:34:51
I caught my twin doing something but she says it’s no big deal ,">OOP: I would totally take it. I don’t think anyone has hugged me since she got admitted. It’s like I’m invisible now

This is quite literally one of the saddest, most heart wrenching things I’ve ever heard someone say in my 40 years on this earth.  

OOP said her parents are really young. And I know that they say when someone has a child as a teen, they kind of freeze mentally at that age. But holy shit. Her mom is 33 years old and her dad is 34. GET YOUR FUCKING SHIT TOGETHER.  

Both of her parents are making this about themselves. They’re more worried about how it looks, how they feel, and how this will affect them/their lives, than either of their children. Which actually isn’t difficult to do when they quite literally are willingly incapable of, +/- have an anaphylactic allergy to, giving a shit about anyone other than their own selfish asses. 

OOP is more mature than the two of them combined. She has shown more emotional intelligence, and general intelligence than a lot of grown ass adults I know. She is quite literally, single handedly treading water to keep her and her sister afloat. She has done all of this with grace, kindness, courage, bravery, and sensitivity that are beyond amazing.  

**OOP, if you stumble upon this, and read through the comments - I just wanted to let you know:**  You are an amazing young woman. I have two little girls. If they grow up to be half of the wonderful human you are, I would be elated.  You are doing, and have done, everything right.  But please, do not allow yourself to get lost in the shuffle. Obviously your sister is a priority - but that doesn’t mean your needs are any less important.  Your feelings, wants, needs, and concerns ARE important and deserve to be heard. 

And. Remember, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. If you’re being ignored, be squeaky. Like *REAL SQUEAKY* until your cry for help is heard and something is done about it.  If you’re told you’re just making this all about you, don’t listen to them. Tell them, “Yeah.  Well.  This IS about me right now. And I need help. So what’s your point?”  Never be afraid to advocate for yourself.

As I said, I am a mom to two little girls. I know very little about what your sister is going through. But. If you need a “mom-for-a-minute”, someone to vent to, ask random questions, or just need some support/encouraging words, message me anytime.  I’m no therapist, but I am good at listening. I’m not just offering to be nice. I mean it. I’m here if you need someone to talk to.  

I will be praying for your sister and sending all the mom hugs and positive vibes I can muster, your way.  *Mom Hugs* 💜",1gx0w53,lydwijn,2024-11-22 08:17:53

My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"Therapy, a dietician. If she doesn't want it you can't make her want it. If she's developed one eating disorder to deal with her emotions (food-reward) it's incredibly easy to let it go the other way and develop anorexia/bulemia/ unhealthy weight loss (food restrict/punishment) 

However I think you should stick to your guns and refuse to enable her binges. You have every right to tell her how you feel about it in the most caring way possible, but as a girl who has lost a good amount of weight I don't think you can motivate her to do something she isn't ready to do.

My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"Is your gf passionate about anything? Writing, music or knitting or anything? You need to encourage her to engage in one of those things she loves to do but probably doesn’t right now due to low self esteem and general anxiety.

You have to realise that she is most likely self-medicating with food. You can’t make her stop taking her medicine as long as she feels unwell. She has to be well enough to start breaking down her relationship with food. For that, I believe she needs to engage in activities that she loves or has always wanted to, and do it without pressure of accomplishment but also do it in a way that improves her skill in it.

My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"This isn't a diet/exercise thing so PLEASE get that out of your head and don't listen to the comments like that. This is a mental health thing. You said yourself, its an unhealthy relationship with food because she eats her feelings. If she had someone to talk to about them (like a therapist) she might not feel the need to eat every time she's upset. Think of it as almost an addiction that she needs some mental help overcoming. Lots of people have unhealthy relationships with food. Lots of people also overcome that with proper help. But eating the ""right"" foods or exercising isn't going to change her unhealthy feelings toward eating. Please have her talk to a professional.",lat8i8,glqhce4,2021-02-02 14:49:14
My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"Hey there! Masters in Public Health with a concentration in Physical Activity and Behavior here. The original response is so on point. I’m engaged to someone who has a difficult relationship with food. Sometimes hearing helpful information from your SO can feel like an attack. Instead of focusing the conversation on her. Share with her how you think you need to make a change for your career and it sounds like your mental well being. Ask her if she can be your partner in this change and see how she responds. Focus everything on I need your support, will you help me. 

Also, pursuing the mental health aspect of the “responsive eating” would be best but that often comes with time. Suggesting someone see a specialist can be a very slippery slope. 

Definitely don’t suggest she just under eat and walk more. We have information thrown at us about what we “should” do for our health but having information and applying it to your singular experience are two different things. So any studies have shown that when a couple decide to make changes together, they see better results. 
Good luck, stay strong and protect your well-being!

Just finished reading and I feel like this is going to affect my relationship with food,"This made me really happy to read. I'm excited for you! I think Senshi would be really proud of you for trying new foods, especially when it's so difficult for you. 

It has impacted my relationship with food, too... I hate cooking, my ADHD makes it an exhausting chore for me, and I have issues with low appetite so I often don't even feel hungry or desire to eat. So cooking always feels like a monumental amount of effort for the sake of eating, which I often don't even really want to do.

The messages from DunMeshi have helped me view food as important, and try harder to find ways to make eating enjoyable and tasty for me. It helps me prioritize eating and nutrition, and to be more willing to put more effort into cooking in order to make something that tastes good.

At the same time, it does make me feel frustrated and... Sad? Because I've been trying to find ways to find joy in cooking the way Senshi does and I haven't been succeeding. I still hate cooking. But it will probably take a lot more time and effort for me to be able to see something positive in something I hate, so I might just need to put more work and patience into it. 

Even though I hate making my own food, when I have an appetite I do love eating at restaurants, eating food other people cook, and trying new foods. I think there is a lot of joy in food and trying new things, so I hope you can experience that. I don't know what it's like to have arfid; maybe the goal is something else, like expanding your safe food options or improving your ability to tolerate different foods or being able to add more nutrition to your safe foods or something.

"“Fast metabolism” is a lie, stop making yourself feel bad.","My bff was a skinny rail. I wasn’t even a big kid but I noticed early on she ate like a bird. When I spent the night at her house her dad would get us a candy treat. We’d each get a bag of skittles, I’d wolf mine down and she’d eat 1/2, fold the bag and set aside. 

I was pregnant when she got married and in her wedding party. She told us to come hungry because there would be SOOO much food. Being in the wedding and so busy that day I was starving by the time we ate. It was a plated meal so you got your plate of food vs family style or buffet. Oh my God!  There was a piece of chicken, some green beans and a few roasted potato slices. It barely touched my hunger.

"“Fast metabolism” is a lie, stop making yourself feel bad.","I agree wholeheartedly with your post, OP. I'd just add that I think most ""naturally skinny"" people don't use food as comfort, compared to the way most of us who've struggled with our weight probably do. Of course, you can overeat calories gradually over time and gain weight that way. But many of us have had disregulated appetites and have also used food in an unhealthy way, whether that's comfort eating, food addiction, binge eating, yoyo dieting, etc. for years, causing rapid weight gain and disregulated metabolism. 

""Naturally skinny"" people eat what they want, then move on. Having a large meal just means the next meal, or 2 will be smaller. There's no emotional attachment to comfort food, no guilt for having a blowout, and no spiralling or binging. We see them eating a large meal, precisely because they're not secretly eating thousands of calories when no one is watching. They never worry about being judged for what they're eating because there's no stigma attached to a slim person eating high calorie foods. If anything, they're probably encouraged to and praised for eating like this. 

I do envy people who have no emotional connection to food! It must be much easier for them to eat the right amount for the bodies effortlessly.",1lr1dw5,n17dmxz,2025-07-03 22:02:18

I think it should be said ""small appetite"" because after partnering up with an underweight man, that's what it is. Yes he has an active job and fidgets, but also he just doesn't like to eat often. He doesn't like sweets. He has a small stomach and can't eat big portions.

"“Fast metabolism” is a lie, stop making yourself feel bad.","This is absolutely the answer to a lot of things that differ between people who struggle with food/weight and those who don’t. 

When we rely on subjective info, like how much food is “a lot,” we aren’t taking into account how much variance exists. 

Two slices of pizza and a couple wings is not much to some people but “stuffing my face” to others. Some people eat a Chipotle bowl and still feel hungry whereas others boast about a Chipotle bowl being two full meals. 

This is true of exercise/sedentary behaviors, too. People living in cities that walk/bike a ton would say on a lazy day that they were sedentary, when in fact they still walked 5000 steps. Meanwhile people in car-centric suburbs that walk minimally would say they had a super active day if they got in 5000 steps. 

Or ask a gym rat what it means to have a light day, and I bet their answer would be exactly what somebody who never goes to the gym says is how much they’d do in a single normal or intensive day at the gym.

As someone who has struggled with EDs for most of my life, having my daughter was the turning point for me in my attitude. Not saying I got better overnight, I still struggle, but I would do anything to keep my kids from dealing with the same issues I have

My ED was inherited through multiple generations, and now I’m doing the work to break the cycle. Its bad enough when kids pick up things that parents try to hide, but for your wife to blatantly not give a shit and make you feel bad for your completely correct take is wild

AITAH for telling my wife to stop making her eating disorder obvious to the kids?,"My kid (15m)  just came out of an ED treatment program. He asked me to see a dietician who specializes in ED as part of my supporting him. I have thought, his whole life, that was modeling a positive relationship to food and I have been devastated to learn that I’ve been unconsciously doing the opposite. 

Everything I do related to food is a direct reaction to growing up with a mom with a lifelong undiagnosed eating disorder. She put so much shit in my head that I am only now coming to terms with. I am so glad to be doing the work, but I have made my dietician almost cry at stories of what my mom did and said to me and to herself. And I am so humbled to learn how much of what I do in response to my mom has affected what he does in response to me. (I wanted to do the opposite from my bitchy mom. He and I are close, so he just learned to do what I did, which was overindulge as a “F-you” to my mom.) 

Show this to your wife. She HAS TO GET BETTER. She has to BE better. When she resists, it’s the disorder defending itself, and she has to stop letting it control her thoughts and actions. 

You are not being alarmist. This is affecting the kids. There were several women in my son’s program who were moms. There is nothing wrong with getting help. She can do an outpatient program.

Your wife is 100% TA for making comments about “bad foods” in front of the children. Even if she chooses not to deal with her eating disorder, it’s not okay to expose others to it. 

Your wife needs to go back to therapy, and you should be looking into child therapists for your girls to get ahead of it. **Seriously, do everything you can to get ahead of this illness with the girls even if your wife won’t cooperate.**

OP - this is a hill to die on. 

Your wife apparently does not care enough about the effect she's having on your children to make any changes. Therefore, you need to make the changes, and they probably have to be drastic. 

First, I strongly urge you to get a few sessions with a psychologist who specializes in eating disorders. Talk about how to inoculate your children. Also talk about taking your children away from your wife unless she gets help. 

Seriously - I very rarely recommend leaving, and wouldn't recommend it here, except you have children to consider. You need to get them out of that environment. 

My mother had a mild eating disorder, and she passed it on to me. By the time I was 50, despite having gotten help by that point, I had done so much damage to my body, I could barely walk. The damage I have done is irreversible, and I doubt I'll live to 65. It was a strong contributing factor in my infertility.

She still, to this day (even after telling her how much I hate it), will pinch the skin on her stomach and shake it and make a disgusted face any time she eats or someone compliments her outfit, for example. She will praise me for being thin and then say ""but I was thin like you once. Someday you'll be fat like me."" It makes me want to explode every time she does these things. It's so harmful to me still, even as a grown adult. I know it sounds dramatic, but I really consider it to be abusive behavior. I'm in good shape and I still hate myself because it has such a long term impact.

I would bet OPs daughter is receiving more messaging from her mom than he even knows, explicitly or implicitly. Just because Mom has an eating disorder does not give her permission to be horrid to her kid. Like I said, it's traumatizing and abusive.

I've been in and out of ED treatment (after getting my ED from my mom), and while I don't have kids, I've met women there who do. I have never once heard any of them have this attitude. 

I've heard them say, ""Do your best to treat this before you have kids, because you will give it to your kids."" ""My [son/daughter/etc] has it now, because, you know, they got it from me."" ""I set up a meeting and made amends with my daughter about how I influenced her feelings around food growing up.""  ""I always avoided doing my behaviors in front of my family at the dinner table."" ""I didn't want to model unhealthy behaviors for my kids."" And, most of all, ""My child(ren) are what keep me going / what I remind myself I have to live for / why I'm pursuing treatment / why I want to recover..."" ""They're my 'why'"". 

I've never heard it any other way. Absolutely heartbreaking and appalling that your wife isn't seeing what all these other women I know can see so clearly.

I (18 F) have apparently been dating my best friend (19 M) for an entire year but didn’t know until today. Need help asking him about it.,"So something I’ve thought a lot about recently is that younger teens often have a hard time with online adult conversations and analysis of deeper issues related to women and marginalized people overall. As in, they come across a thread or post or something about men and they get hurt, see it as a personal attack, and feel defensive and angry. It’s then really hard to get them to listen or understand the finer aspects of the issue especially if it’s something super unfamiliar to them. Which happens if it’s, let’s say, a women’s issue and we’re talking about a younger teenage guy who doesn’t spend time around girls and sees them as intimidating, or might not have good female role models. This can feed into the self esteem issues that the guy already has and then also make him think girls dislike him, while he’s also filled with resentment and avoidance.


That’s when YouTube recommendations, podcasts and other toxic content come in. They’re marketed to men who are feeling frustrated and lonely and isolated, it’s like a warm hug of “it’s not you, it’s them” and a lot of the videos seem like they’re all about self improvement and confidence.. at first. The people making these videos also simultaneously paint women and general people who disagree as unstable, irrational, hysterical, abusive, manipulative, etc. Men in general struggle with not receiving a lot of emotional support and emotional comfort (or physical affection) and these videos essentially fill that void, at least a little bit. 


Now lots of adult men will eventually pick up on the crazy parts of the videos but younger people are impressionable and the videos essentially teach them to not trust anyone else’s opinion because the world is against them. This is then validated when others react negatively to their behaviour (even if negative reactions make sense) and it pulls them further in. It’s a vicious cycle and I think they need a combination of personal self awareness, community support and emotional support to break out of it, but sometimes it’s the same people who act cruel and push everyone away and refuse help.",11ulyhm,jcp4r2o,2023-03-18 14:08:51

Need help asking him about it.,"Sure so I work in public education, but I have also spent the last ten years teaching martial arts. My studio is often asked to teach self defense courses for local colleges, as well as groups of women. The issue with teaching self defense courses is that at the end of the day you can only impart a limited amount of martial proficiency in less than ten weeks.

The bulk of good self defense training comes in the form of teaching preventative tactics. Possibly the most valuable of these is coaching individuals in recognizing predatory behaviors. A book my studio often employs as a resource is, ""The Gift of Fear.""

The concept of forced pairing is something that predators use to create a false sense of partnership between them and their victims. In short the idea is to use team language, and manufacture a scenario in which they can create a unilaterally defined partnership. It can be as simple as saying let's get those groceries up to your apartment. We can see this here where the predator is using pet names, ""babe, sweetheart"" as well as curating scenarios where the victim feels obligation to pair with him.

Another tell tale tactic is when she is laying on the bed. One of the grooming methods employed by predators is to gradually initiate physical contact, in order to test their victims boundaries.

Finally the gas lighting tactics he employs in their final confrontation. Predators will try to make their victims feel at fault when the victim becomes uncomfortable with them. This is a way to abuse and control other people.

What's really scary about a lot of predatory behaviors is that many of these tactics are adjacent to normal communication, and can often be disregarded. However the bottom line is if you ever notice yourself in a situation that you find uncomfortable; or with someone who just doesn't feel right, you should always trust your gut. You do not owe anything to anyone. If someone seems off to you, you are perfectly justified in not dealing with them. If someone repeatedly violates your boundaries with no regard for your agency, they are dangerous. There is nothing wrong with cutting someone out with zero explanation to that person. Always value your own safety above all else.",11ulyhm,jcqpohy,2023-03-18 20:43:58

Before she even mentioned Tate, and before I even read about their convo at the coffee shop, I just KNEW it was going there.   The fact he kissed her and became affectionate out of the blue was the tip-off.  It’s not normal to be in a relationship that long without any kind of affection displayed or even a peck on the lips at the very least. He would have had to known kissing her like that would have thrown her for a loop, but he must’ve read or heard that doing so might put her in a position to just go along wit it.

Commenter: Well, the connection between sex and pregnancy has been known since antiquity. People recognised that women who have never had sex never got pregnant.

OOP: But how did people realise that? If you see a pregnant woman, how would you know if she's had sex or not?

Commenter: ...the woman would know.

A lot of people, even otherwise well-meaning people, just kind of never consider the idea that women are also sentient and can observe the things happening around them and form their own thoughts and opinions.

This is also why men seeking advice on how to approach women get really upset when given advice like ""just treat her like a person, talk to her normally."" They say, ""I tried that and it didn't work!"" What do you mean it didn't work, you did successfully talk to her, didn't you? ""Yes, but she wouldn't go on a date with me!"" See, they're being dishonest when they say they want advice on how to talk to women. What they *really* want is advice on how to make a woman romantically interested in them, a cheat code they can plug in and get laid as a result.

Parents teaching their children about how to handle one-sided affection and rejection are not doing a good job at catering that lesson towards someone in the throes of a testosterone-filled puberty. The main reason is because the primary person expected to do this sort of socioemotional child rearing has never gone through it. The secondary person has either already matured 15+ years from it, or worse, learned how to cope in those same exact toxic misogynistic ways.

I know soooo many emotionally intelligent and actively involved millennial dads. Many of whom I have personally witnessed reinforcing intergender compassion and respect. So I do have a lot of hope for the next generation of sons, but it will take a lot of really solid parenting to counteract the lure of the superficial, pride-preserving ""explanations"" of the online manosphere.",11ulyhm,jcpxone,2023-03-18 17:28:46

All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men. The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire… those are, overwhelmingly, other men. In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal. From women they want devotion, service and sex. 

Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving.”

>Emily looked like she was about to cry. She is neurodivergent and a lot of food taste's and textures really bother her, tomatoes being a large one. My husband doesn't seem to care

Oh EFF THAT! Insisting on a treat meal containing a food the kid can't stand is just about control and is cruel. It's literally putting food ideology before her total wellbeing. If vegetables were so important, why didn't he  tell her BEFORE ordering that she had to pick a vegetable with her meal?

What your husband actually taught your kid is ""because he said-so.""  Because if vegetables were the main part. He would have asked her to pick a vegetable as a side dish to have with her bacon burger. Even if he'd forgotten beforehand, he could have asked her what vegetable she picked. He didn't. He decided to punish a 12 year old because she didn't pick a treat meal healthy enough to his liking and ordered a food that makes her unable to eat her meal. He's 100% the AH.

Edit:I have 4 kids. Restaurant meals and parties, we do not insist on eating anything other than what they will actually eat. Why create a problem where there isn't one?

An ex boyfriend of mine (we remain friends to this day) had a very privileged upbringing in Nigeria. We used to eat in Nando’s a lot, and my 3 sons (5 & 6) though it was a great joke that he ordered a whole chicken for himself, and ate everything on his plate, bones and all. The restaurant staff all pulled a surprised face when clearing the table as one plate out of four was sparkling clean. The boys thought this was hilarious and openly laughed until their sides hurt watching him bite the joint from the top of the leg bone. His family was anything but poor, the difference was environmental since it was heavily frowned upon to waste food under any circumstances and his mum raised them to be grateful for everything they had.


Every English person who ate with him couldn’t believe the bones were edible. I did eat a couple to say I had tried, and they were surprisingly palatable. I never allowed the boys to eat them because I was concerned about splintering for the same reason I wouldn’t give cooked chicken bones to pets.

I’ve never known anyone specifically eat chicken marrow, but I do make sure I saw beef and lamb bones in half and boil out the marrow into the stock to make the gravy and it’s delicious.

"My boyfriend called me “fucking disgusting” for the way I eat chicken, and I can’t stop thinking about it.","I've always told friends (from experience), that the very first real problem you have in a relationship is indicative of what will ultimately end the relationship. It is in that moment you decide whether or not you're going to put it aside and go through the motions of the relationship anyway, or choose to recognize the incompatibility and save yourself the future heartache.

By this I mean, as others have said, this isn't about a ""chicken joke,"" but rather about the action of casually denigrating and humiliating you publicly, then refusing to take even an ounce of responsibility. He denies its effects on you and furthermore, doesn't even seem to care. *That's* your issue here, not the chicken.

If you go against your gut feelings right now, you're giving him the permission to treat you this way from this point forward because you are essentially telling him there are no consequences to his actions and you won't do anything at all to stand up for yourself. In the future, he'll not only continue this type of behavior, but push the boundaries further to see what else you give him permission to do and trust me, it'll get worse, much worse.

Respect yourself. It's been less than 6 months. Tap out. Tell him why, and don't frame it as a ""chicken joke."" Tell him that it's simply not ok to treat you that way, you **won't** be treated that way, ie, casually publicly denigrated without even a hint of consideration to your feelings, and no culpability for his actions. Do NOT let him backtrack. Be firm. Otherwise, you're still saying it's ok.

I've learned from experience that only I set the rules for how others treat me, and I see the signs early, take no shit, and give no justifications for the standards I set for myself; they are mine and mine alone.

Set the standard for yourself. Tell this dude to kick rocks and don't waste another minute on him that could go to someone who actually deserves your time because they *do* respect your standards for yourself, naturally.",17nh98q,k7s284k,2023-11-04 12:19:29

If ASD, the disorder essentially heightens senses so taste, texture, and ect can be overwhelming and does lead to a lot of expense in food, waste, and sudden shifts in what tastes ""right."" Even finding cheaper options may not work since variation won't ""taste right."" Knowing can at least lead you in a better direction.

my frozen pizza is £3 for one.

I normally only eat once a day (can't eat breakfast it makes me sick and then if I eat between lunch and dinner I can make it stretch) but for a child they should really be eating at least twice a day, ideally 3 times

my safe foods average out at £2.75 a meal so eating 3 times a day that's £8.25 and across a week that's £57.75 which is a lot when you only have £70 (per month or per week OP doesn't say) and that £70 is supposed to feed 3 people!

My daughters eating disorder is killing me financially.,"do you have access to food banks or the uk version of food stamps?  bc that's what id' suggest if you were in the states.  not for her, but for you and the rest of your family to supplement her eating.  

in the arfid and chronic illness communities im part of, which have an overlap in not having an appetite/nausea toward food, as well as in the loss of nutrition that comes with it, there's often a saying:

""fed is best.  nutrition comes next.""  so i'd suggest making sure she can be fed, consistently.  and then that gives you space to work out ways to help her increase the health.  this is really hard on low income, i know.  at my sickest point, i couldn't afford any food that was appetizing.  the few things i could afford made me cry trying to shove down my throat, or made me sick from bad ingredients.  

a good way to work with arfid is to not shame any food choices, to be honest if you sometimes don't like it too.  but to model being brave and trying a food (without expecting the child to also try it- but cool if they do).  and to model putting it out, trying a few, and saying you can try this too if you like!  another thing that can help is the parent modeling that they enjoy the foods, oh this is so good, oh i love how my body feels when i eat these blueberries!  etc.  

you can look up ""arfid"" on instagram and probably find some good accounts.  there are grownups with arfid out there trying new foods, there are children's nutritionists showing healthy ways to help a child expand their palate without stressing you both out more and creating more food trauma. 

i can't recommend anyone specifically off the top of my head.  but there's ideas out there.  you'll probably get the most help by watching others working through this and finding ways to inch her toward more foods.  even a couple foods would help you here.  it can be slow though!  if you go too fast, you could just overwhelm her.

she likely eats that way in part bc the other foods literally taste nasty to her body.  so help her body learn to like things.  please never trick or force her- my mom did that shit and it caused me a LOT of long time issues.

My eating disorder was a choice.,"I feel like it's more complicated than that. *A lot* of teenage girls decide they're going to be anorexic, it's super common. However most do not actually become anorexic. Most people don't even have the capacity to make themselves restrict to the point of anorexia (and that's a good thing - having your brain intervene so you don't starve to death is a good trait to have). 

You grew up in a culture where being thin is valued and where young girls often associate anorexia = thin = good and so you, like many, decided you wanted to be anorexic. However, you did not choose everything else about yourself, the social, psychological, biological factors that made it so that you actually did develop anorexia. And no 13-year-old truly understands the long-term consequences of their choices, let alone everything that anorexia actually entails.

So you chose it, but did you really, in any meaningful sense of the word?

You're definitely allowed to feel however you want about it, but personally, having done the same thing when I was 12, I think it's a whole lot more complicated than a real choice. Maybe I chose to start restricting when I was 12, but at that point to me all it really meant was that I would get even skinnier than I already was. I absolutely did not choose the lifetime of an eating disorder that would follow, completely upending my life, health, and relationships, and destroying all other goals I had for my life.",15hlcov,jupyf38,2023-08-04 04:36:12

I feel like a case could potentially be made for this statement, but this post almost goes to show how much this wasn't a choice.  I know the reality is difficult, but please don't further confuse yourself with the notion that picking your coping method of choice makes it a choice.  If you replace ""eating disorder"" with ""prostitution"" in this post (which, by the way, I believe in sex workers' rights to exit if they no longer want to be one anymore and to exist peacefully without the coercion of capitalism regardless of their choice), it will come across just as clear that the person made choices under life circumstances that have greatly reduced their options.

Realized I Developed an Eating Disorder - A Word of Warning,"The switch to maintenance can be very hard. After a long time in a deficit you get used to the mindset and it's scary to break. I know it was for me.

One realization I had to accept is that I've never had a healthy relationship with food. I didn't have one when I was gaining to morbid obesity, and I didn't have one while restricting for over a year and a half. Yes, the weight loss was needed for my health, but the mindset of constant restriction isn't a healthy mindset for a lifetime of eating. It's only been in maintenance that I've finally started to learn what healthy looks like.

One thing that helped me was realizing that I wasn't always binging when I overate. I have watched my calorie intake a lot as I've been trying to let hunger guide me. Some days I naturally undereat and others I overeat. It all balances out though. I bet you know naturally skinny people who do the same thing. It's a normal and healthy eating pattern. What isn't healthy is to consider each time a binge. That leads to a pattern of restriction and actual binges. 

The biggest thing I can tell you is to remember that you lost the weight, you know how to lose, so you can always lose again if you gain weight. Let yourself have a range to try to sit in, and remember you can control it if you go over that range. It would only take a week or two to do so. 

Lastly, even on sedentary days you might have a higher tdee than being sedentary. Trust the math. You lost the weight by trusting the math, you will maintain by trusting the math. Like even when you feel fat or like you shouldn't, trust the math anyways. 

I don't know if that helps at all, but trust me that you're not alone. Besides myself, both Jordan Shrinks and obese to beast are people on YouTube who lost a lot of weight and dealt with eating disorders afterwards. They've made some videos about it and how they got through it. It might help to look them up. Jordan Shrinks has also talked about dealing with exercise addiction post weight loss.",behbkm,el61pud,2019-04-18 06:00:53

Ugh hopefully we’re beyond that now as a society - but I dunno because I’m not anywhere close to a field like fashion where this may still be prevalent.

I also noticed that when Mark has his reintegration moment when looking at the fridge in Ep 6, there's only two lunch bags. Ben Stiller mentioned on the podcast that the outies chose their innie's lunches each week, and so it seems like Helena doesn't even allow Helly to have lunch at work. I can't imagine having to get through the stress and craziness of work on the severed floor while only having eaten two bites of a hard-boiled egg and maybe a Lumon approved fruit leather.

Do I think Helena is a good person? Definitely not. But I do feel bad for her.

When Helena mentioned telling him about what happened at the ORTBO, Natalie and Mr Drummond said they wouldn't inform him of it. I doubt Jame would willingly let Helena go back down to the severed floor if he knew Helly would be in control for 8 hours a day. Also, aside from the bathroom scene from the S1 finale, there was also a cut scene from the script where he sees the security footage of Helly and Mark kissing and calls her a bitch. He likely sees Helly as a completely separate entity from his daughter, or possibly a corrupted form of her (like the Dieter Eagan story). I'm not 100% sure what he's referring to during the scene in last week's episode, but I think, overall, the lack of control he has over his daughter while she's on the severed floor deeply bothers him.",1jchglh,mi2sbyr,2025-03-16 12:26:20

OP Accidentally Trained Her Cat To Be An Eating Disorder Support Pet (July 2021 TrueOffMyChest),One xmas I was out of state and couldn't spend it with family. I was crying in my bedroom with the door shut when I heard something being shoved under the door. My cat had found a piece of holiday candy and brought it to me. I let him in and he snuggled me til I stopped crying. That ginger baby loved me better than nearly every human I've ever known. He died a few years ago and I still really miss him.

My cat would try to get my attention by meowing, pawing, licking, and even biting, but I wouldn't even lift my hand to shrug her off. She finally pestered my mom and yelled at her until she followed her to my room where she stood on my chest and yowled. There was nothing wrong with me but the fact I would not respond to her was apparently alarming and she had to get someone.

AITA for having flavored sparking water at my teenage daughter's birthday party? Another mom accused me of trying to give her daughter an eating disorder.,"lol, this what my first thought reading this too. ""Artificial replacement for soda"" beacuse soda is such a natural whole food? Soda is obviously artificial, you know a man made product that dosen't occur in nature.

And this woman has major issues around food and eating which sadly she is messing up her kids with, by making scenes like this, not letting them eat anything low in calories, and having big emotional issues around food. 

There is nothing wrong with kids eating ""diet"" products. So long as by diet products one means more healthy alternatives to junk food (soda) like she seems too? I mean obviously you wouldn't want to give kids drugs to lose weight. But if if someone baked low sugar muffins with whole wheat flour and their kid ate and liked them, would they really be upset about that?

And it's a ""diet"" food to this woman who is used to having soda on the regular, but to some people it's just what they eat. It's like the people who judge someone for having a salad, that they must be on a diet, that they have unhealthy ideas about eating, blah blah. But really, some of like salads. I don't always order salads, but sometimes I do and really enjoy them. She basically thinks no one should be allowed to eat or serve food that is healthier or lower calorie then what she personally chooses to eat beacuse if so they're trying to force ""diet culture"" on her kid.  Only what is a diet food for her may just be part of other people's normal foods they eat, without it being about their weight. She's making it about weight, you aren't.

And the fact that she could see a meal with pizza, burgers, guac, etc and say since there was not soda too it's a diet meal is a bit crazy. Her thinking is warped. NTA.",nhxtam,gyz8wf7,2021-05-21 19:40:01

AITA for having flavored sparking water at my teenage daughter's birthday party? Another mom accused me of trying to give her daughter an eating disorder.,">This was my thought too. I completely understand a parent not wanting their child to have aspartame, but unsweetened sparkling water seems completely inoffensive.

I mean.... even if you don't want your kid to have aspartame, this is still objectively ridiculous behavior. It's not some other parents job to police your kid's drink choices and plain old water is still available.",nhxtam,gyza4xf,2021-05-21 19:49:52

AITA for having flavored sparking water at my teenage daughter's birthday party? Another mom accused me of trying to give her daughter an eating disorder.,"I've never heard the term cordial used in the context you mentioned! I use it to mean a higher quality squash, something sweetened and fruity. Elderflower is the one most associated in my mind with the term cordial, and is absolutely delicious. I've made spiced elderberry cordials before too. There's a wild cherry in my back garden that produces the smallest cherries with the biggest stones, but when boiled in sugar syrup then strained made the most scrumptious red cordial. Not particularly cherry-ish but wonderfully fruity.

If you're looking to buy it (UK based) Belvoir is a really good brand. Or Rocks for a more traditional squash (so lemon, orange, or blackcurrent, with the added bonus of being Organic). Other brands are available, but if I'm not making it those are usually my go-to!

Emily is exploiting her child’s eating disorder for job security & it’s disgusting.,"Emily is something of a shape shifter, she will change the narrative in the moment to benefit herself, even if that means using her children.  Earlier seasons, didn’t she go down the rabbit hole of having a poor relationship with her mother because of her mother‘s mental health? Which I also thought she was exploiting. But yet she can become very explosive about the nanny/babysitter talking about how her kids don’t like somebody. Part of me thinks Emily actually needs to get her ass back to work to give her something to do rather than grouse and create drama.",1m06a8z,n370tl9,2025-07-15 02:47:35
Emily is exploiting her child’s eating disorder for job security & it’s disgusting.,"I do kind of like ARFID becoming a more talked about topic on reality TV, but in the context of a child and also being randomly brought up multiple times in episode 1 for a story line, yes it’s exploitative. However, I do honestly think if sharing a story can help other parents who are like “why is my child such a picky eater??” realize there’s more to it than being picky, that’s at least good. 

I grew up being a “picky eater”, realizing now I had severe ARFID. Constantly gagging, being so sensitive to smells, not eating anything even if I was starving, being severely deficient in vitamins wasn’t normal, yet it was labelled as no big deal by my doctor. I also had raging ADHD. But I did well in school so again, everything was just written off as a quirk, until those quirks wreaked havoc on my 20s. Now that my mom is educated on autism & adhd she wishes she knew sooner to help me get the support I needed.",1m06a8z,n374qsg,2025-07-15 03:12:25
Emily is exploiting her child’s eating disorder for job security & it’s disgusting.,"I understand what you’re saying and don’t think children should be storylines on Housewives. Where I’m conflicted is Heather Dubrow has been a good advocate for the LGBTQ+ community. And Jenni from Jersey Shore has been very public on her son’s autism and an advocate for the community. 

I think the difference in my mind with those 2 examples is their advocacy is not their storyline. They are vocal and involved outside of their shows. And public figures, even housewives or those that fist pumped their way through their 20s, can bring a lot of awareness to their communities. The non-show advocacy by Heather and Jenni can also be better controlled to protect their children rather than relying on awful Bravo producers to cherry pick statements and scenes.",1m06a8z,n3716q2,2025-07-15 02:49:51

Including strawberry milkshakes made with a crapton of fresh strawberries, which I promise is relevant to all this.  I began my pregnancy as a tall 127 lbs. By month seven I was inching towards 140.

And then I made the mistake of drinking one of those strawberry shakes before being tested for gestational diabetes. 

The test came back as a Probably Yes, and they immediately scheduled me for daily at-home diabetes tests and a visit with a nutritionist, who promptly sat me down and warned me sternly that I Just Cannot Keep OverEating Like This.  The baby would be born with a head the size of a bowling-ball, he said. The baby would run the risk of all sorts of mental and physical problems, he said. Just starting out! Not even born yet! And it's bad for you of course, he said. Eating junk food like this. Fatty foods. Sugars. Cakes.   

In short, it was essential that I cease my gorging immediately, and transition onto an 1100-calorie per day diet. 

&nbsp;

Which was super funny, because I remembered my mom doing Weight Watchers when I was a kid. At 5'8"", her target for healthy weight-loss was 1200 calories/day. 

&nbsp;

Long story short: fuck this shit, okay? My daily tests confirmed that I wasn't diabetic. My ob/gyn confirmed that 1100/day was indeed a weight-loss plan for a woman of my height, at my stage of pregnancy, and firmly advised against it.   Some doctors are just absolutely nuts when it comes to women's weight during pregnancy. That's all this is, and I'm so sorry you had this shitty experience.",1g9n5tk,lt8htmi,2024-10-22 20:58:33

I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"Thank you... I've always struggled with guilt, and help. It's like you read my mind... So thank you, for putting it so bluntly, picking it apart and giving such a thoughtful reply. I think part of me feels like it's my fault she's not eating... That I've done this to her. 

I had a conversation with a friend about it... It went like this...

Him- she's just not hungry, it's fine
Me- she's really skinny, it's not fine, she needs to eat
Him- na, she doesn't, she will eat when she wants to
Me- she's severely underweight!
Him- she's not starving, she looks fine
Me- you can feel all of her bones, she's not fine
Him- yeah but she looks better like that
Me- wtf?!
Him- see? It's not fine is it. Now you know how we feel. Annoying isn't it...

I've told other people and they all laugh because it's such a similar situation... But it's not. They didn't watch me day by day, or even week to week... But I think maybe the similarities in our situations make me feel even more guilt. Because my friends feel like this is something I should've just snapped out of and that it's my own fault. So I feel like I've caused it for her too...

Sorry this is so long, I'm aware you're not my therapist (oh lord I hope not...), But it's been quite cathartic to get it out",mpi934,guat2mx,2021-04-12 21:14:42
I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"No problem lol (and don't worry I'm no one's therapist lol, just trying to help you see it for what it really is)

I've lived my entire life seeing what this kind of thing is like for people, even experienced it myself in my own way. It's not really something people tend to understand unless they've been through something similar. 

There's even people in wheelchairs that get harassed by strangers because the stranger assumes that it's being faked. This is obviously an extreme example but it happens a lot more than you'd think. 

Still though don't look down on that stranger, or your friends, for feeling this way. They don't have to understand because there's no need for them too, at least in the sense that it won't help them because it's not something they have to go through. 

Instead of being upset at them for feeling the way they do, try and accept them and teach them instead. You never know, they might even have a reason for feeling as such (in my example above it could be that person had a parent who faked the disability). 

The truth is though, they only see it through their own eyes and in their own way. There's a chance they'll never even understand but that's okay because they do see something is wrong and are trying to communicate, in their own way, to you that they're concerned. The person who said that didn't say it for any negative reasons other than just to try and show you how concerned they are and how they feel seeing you go through this. They're showing you they care and trying to give you their eyes. 

They can't understand completely (thus they don't see the differences) but they can try to share with you how they feel about it (thus they say it's similar, because to them, it is)",mpi934,guaxsxn,2021-04-12 21:51:59
I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"Hun. A relapse could mean *your* death. And your cat understands this. 

Remember watching her get skinnier every day? Worrying about her not eating? All those panicked trips to the vet trying to figure out what was going on? Thinking she was sick, maybe dying? 

*Your cat is seeing the very same thing with you.* Shes watching you not eat. Shes scared you're sick or dying. She sees how deathly thin you get.  But she doesn't have the ability to rush you to the doctor and pay for tests and exams and food changes. 

The same anxiety you have over her, shes having over you. 

Your her human. She loves you. She's scared for you. If you die, shes not going to know what to do. 

Momma cats, when their babies go without food, will often starve themselves so their babies can eat. Your cat is doing this to you right now. If you don't eat, she won't either. Its a choice shes actively choosing to make because she *wants* you to live and get strong and healthy. The same way you want her to. 

You absolutely deserve this loving cat. Its clear that she would be lost without you and the strong bond you share.

Eating disorders aren't easy. No disorder is easy. But, take it one step at a time. If all you can manage is a single carrot, it still counts. It still shows your cat you're trying to eat. 

If you haven't already, and you're able to, look into therapists that specialize in eating disorders. It helps. Take every day one step at a time. A single carrot. A half bowl of cereal. A small salad. Every piece you keep down is a success. 

Don't look at it as *failing* because you aren't done trying yet. Its just another step in the right direction. And you will get there eventually. I believe in you. So does your cat.",mpi934,guasvq7,2021-04-12 21:13:12
I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"That's a really good way to look at it. Thank you...

Involved/concerned/affected? Someone else commented that how I feel watching Lily fade day by day is how she sees me... And it made me think. 

I've been an absolute mess for weeks about it. Now I'm starting to understand their perspective better. You don't need to be involved in the daily care of someone to feel those things. And feeling those things is completely valid.",mpi934,guaz40l,2021-04-12 22:02:38
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"YTA. If you were concerned for her, you could have just told her that you wouldn’t be offended if she preferred to step down if being in the wedding was creating any extra pressure. You could’ve told her you want her there and happy and would support her in whatever that means. 

But you wanted her out of the wedding so it doesn’t create a headache for you if she relapses or can’t maintain a size. It was not motivated by her or her health. Why didn’t you anticipate this before asking her? This was perhaps the worst possible outcome. Now she has a visible sign of her failure tied to her weight and health which has led to her exclusion from her sisters even before a relapse. Very insensitive and risky choice on your part.

Also, you should be able to reflect as an adult on whether the dieting during childhood was really a better choice for her “health” because I’m mighty suspicious of that. What health issues did she have that required a diet? A clogged artery at 15?",kl5el7,gh6x2a8,2020-12-27 15:38:49
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"YTA.

And a hypocrite, too. You didn't have the respect for her to communicate beyond a *text* asking her do drop out of your wedding party, a conversation which really should be done in person if you actually care, and now you're getting mad at her for not wanting to talk to you? 

Not only that, but your objections aren't because of her health. You're bothered by the chance that she could inconvenience you by checking into a rehab facility, or by needing her dress refitted. 

Not a single one of you cares enough about your sister to actually *talk to her* like the adult she is, y'all are just trying to make decisions for her like she's still 5 years old.

As a now fat person, we get that sort of ""It's for YOUR OWN GOOD"" nonsense a lot and most of the time it's just unexamined, internalized fatphobia. Go examine your and your family's shit, educate yourself on fatphobia, apologize for what you did, and invite her back to your wedding party, although she may not want to any more. Depending on how bad your family as been, she may not trust you on it.",kl5el7,gh6z308,2020-12-27 15:59:07
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"
Obviously some of the commenters have never had to deal with siblings that have mental health issues.

Your sister is relapsing. That is awful. When she does relapse, OP said that her sister is flaky. Why would she want someone who might not even show up to be in her wedding. OP is worried about dress fittings pushing her sister further down the ED hole. That is a valid fear.

And also, it sounds like your sister has been battling an ED for a long time. Honestly? That takes a toll on the siblings. Both of my siblings have health problems and my needs were pushed to the side growing up. I didn't get as much attention or one on one care because my parents were always occupied with my siblings. And I get it! I understand why.

 But I also understand being tired of everything revolving around your siblings illness, and the negative impacts it has. A wedding is supposed to be all about the couple.

What do you guys think is gonna happen if her sister remains a bridesmaid?

-The fittings will absolutely harm her self esteem. Don't kid yourself on that.

-She might not even show up, which leaves OP with a huge problem, plus all of her family will be focusing on the sister instead of the couple actually getting married.

-If the sister does show up, she may spend half the time in the bathroom crying or having a meltdown. In that case, family will go to her and try to comfort her, instead of celebrating the bride and groom.

All OP wants is her wedding to go smoothly and be about her and her hubby. It would put less pressure on her sister to have her not be a bridesmaid, and yes the wedding would go smoother if the sister was just a normal guess.

And for all you ignorant ducks who are calling her a fat shamer, it's clear you've never dealt with siblings or family members with eating disorders or other mental health problems. It is extremely hard for families as well, siblings in particular. 

NAH, your sister has a right to be sad, but ultimately I understand why you're doing what you're doing.",kl5el7,gh7jg9v,2020-12-27 19:02:13
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"Probably going to get downvoted but NAH. There are too many land mines in this situation for you to have navigated it without stepping on one. I see three scenarios that all would have played out badly no matter what

1. Don’t invite her to be a bridesmaid at all, which means she feels excluded and potentially ties this to her weight.

2. Invite her which means she has to go thru fittings and whatnot which is potentially triggering.

3. What actually happened, wherein you wanted to include her but ultimately decided based on warning signs you’re seeing that you’re concerned for her health and asked her to step down.

Between the three I don’t see any way where you could have done something differently and gotten a different outcome, short of eloping before you ever asked anyone to be in the wedding. I also don’t think you’re an asshole for caring about your wedding- wanting a happy wedding day doesn’t mean you don’t care about your sister. I feel like if that were the case, you wouldn’t be giving any of this a second thought or trying to consider how best to include and accommodate her all at once.",kl5el7,gh7e36f,2020-12-27 18:17:00
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"NAH. I know this isn't the trend on this thread today but honestly I can see where you're coming from. I don't have an ED (dodged that bullet, I did have some unhealthy food ideas when younger) but a good friend did and I can see how you were trying to protect your sister. 


I can imagine how many potential triggers a day like a wedding could create- it's all about looking nice, it's all about the bridesmaids matching and her having a little extra weight may trigger her, and then she'll feel guilty for ruining the day, then she will spiral and get sick and you'll feel guilty and she will feel guilty for making you feel guilty... 

Honestly I think you had the right idea. However, I think you need to reframe it for your sister. Explain these fears to her, say you're terrified because you don't want her to suffer, ask her what support she needs and ask her to keep an open dialogue with you about her feelings... Then maybe ask her to be a bridesmaid but in a less vital capacity, just so she doesn't feel as much pressure but can still be there on the day if she is well in herself to attend. I think that you do care, OP. And I also think you're also allowed to worry about how this may also affect your already stressful big day.",kl5el7,gh7dpkg,2020-12-27 18:13:43
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"NAH. I think other commenters are being too harsh on OP and forget that others are negatively affected by mental health. You want your sister to be herself and not triggered into relapse. Thats the way I read it. Dress fittings can be triggering. Weddings can be triggering. If this is a pattern, you have seen it. Its also difficult to be the relative of someone who is coping with this. People forget that too. Imagine your sister has an addiction. Youve seen it before, the cycle of relapse. Theres AA for the addict and Al-Anon for the family. Its hard on you too. Its not a bad thing to take care of yourself. Thats why theres support groups for family members of those with these kinds of issues. Yes, her feelings are hurt, but shes not starving herself and passing out on your wedding day (hopefully). Now she can focus on breaking the cycle and not on her sister's wedding and the bride can have 1 day that isnt focused on someone else or feel bad for possibly triggering her sister. 

Either way, sis was probably going to be triggered. Thats how mental illness works, she is already relapsing.",kl5el7,gh76moc,2020-12-27 17:10:47

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"I wanna clarify something - OP, she didn’t step down from your wedding party. You kicked her out of your wedding party because of her mental illness, which you then proceeded to minimize by talking about your *own* mental illness. 

What you did is like your sister kicking you out of her wedding party due to your BPD/anxiety. Jesus Christ. “Hey, listen OP.. I have an unfounded feeling my wedding, that you agreed to be in and were looking forward to, might trigger your anxiety and just ruin the *whole* thing, so would you mind, like, not being in it? That way I won’t even care if you’re there or not. I’m just looking out for you.”

You noticed she gained weight and asked how she was doing, not because you care, but so you could decide whether or not you should break the news she’s no longer in your wedding. She confided in you that she was struggling and your immediate concern was how that could affect you. 

Also, talking about how much her ED affected you growing up?? What?? 🤯

“God forbid one single day doesn’t revolve around her I guess”

Again, what?! Anything other than forcing her to “step down” would be making the whole thing revolve around her?? Listen to yourself. I’m usually very much “my wedding, my rules” but what a terribly, terribly selfish sister. What a self obsessed asshole in general. 

Also, don’t act so shocked that people are saying a chubby girl growing up with a bunch of “petite” sisters and a mom that pushes her to diet could possibly trigger an eating disorder. Do some research.",kl5el7,gh7y3f8,2020-12-27 21:06:20

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"Right. This was where the real deciding factor became apparent.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"I could be wrong, but I didn't read that as OP wanting Julia to be a certain weight. 

I read that as Julia getting to be free of planning on being on display/ in a specific dress that day, free of that anxiety, so that her mental health and physical health wasn't put at risk. 

If she's not a bridesmaid, there's no need to pick a dress ahead of time that has to still fit on the day, she can pick a dress that fits right before. Basically the bridesmaid role/ dress could cause anxiety for Julia that would lead to a bad health outcome (and disrupting OP's wedding day).

I think the reasoning behind not wanting Julia to be a bridesmaid is both considerate of Julia's triggers/ patterns, and yeah, also avoiding bridal party issues for OP's wedding day. The approach is where... I don't know how to do that tactfully/ without being an asshole.",kl5el7,gh7bgku,2020-12-27 17:54:01

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"YTA. I have an eating disorder also. I can understand why the dress fitting could be a trigger, but when it gets down to it that’s down to Julia if she can manage it or not. 

And no matter how OP phrased it, Julia’s going to see the cause of her being uninvited from the wedding as her gaining weight. That basically is the cause: Julia gains 20 lbs -> no longer bridesmaid. And 20 lbs in 11 months isn’t a lot?! I’m currently relapsing and I’ve gained 20 lbs in a MONTH, lol. It’s entirely possible that the 20 lbs was recovery weight (especially as you said she seemed to be recovering when you last saw her).",kl5el7,gh77nmo,2020-12-27 17:20:07

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"Tbh as someone with an ED myself, I'm surprised that I had to scroll so far down for a comment that wasn't Y T A. I don't think OP is TA, and I agree with what you're saying. Having an ED is tough on everyone who cares about you and I think OP is trying her best in a difficult situation. It is hard to admit to a relapse so it's likely the sister would not have admitted to it, especially with the added pressure of not wanting to ruin OPs wedding by dropping out or something. 

Of course, if I was in that position, I would be hurt as my first reaction, but ultimately would realise that it's probably for the best. Sure, maybe OP could've handled it more tactfully but, idk it's an uncomfortable situation at best. 

OP, I would suggest that you try to have another sit down with your sister and tell her that you, by no means, meant to dictate what she can and cannot do, that you would love to have her in your bridal party, but you really really want her to consider what would be best for her mental health first and foremost. Then detail exactly what you are expecting from her as a bridesmaid vs her as a guest, and let her decide whether she is capable or not.

I also really don't blame OP for wanting to have her wedding as stress free as possible. They have spent a lot of time, effort, and money planning a wedding and they should have a lovely happy day to celebrate OP and her hubby-to-be. This would be so much more difficult if OPs sister is suffering a relapse, and they KNOW it's because she's in the wedding party due to some sense of familial obligation. 

Also, tbh, I know that a lot of people see it as OP dictating what sister should do, but sometimes, removing the choice from someone is the best option. I know it is for me sometimes. If OP does ask sister, ofc sister wants to be included, will she choose it over the risk to her mental health? Possibly! If OP knows this about sister, maybe its better to be the AH for a little while and spare sister from a choice that may make her mental health worse, or conversely that may make her feel guilty.

There are many studies about what happens when one child has a disability and other children feel like all of the attention goes to that child and that the well children's lives are a secondary thought.

Oh you breaking out so bad? That’s because you’re eating all that greasy food. You know it couldn’t be because i was going through puberty.

Forced into track and sports so I could “workout” parents only praised or talked about what I was doing if it was fitness related. 

4mo in college I went on a all liquid diet and for about 3 mo after that I was terrified of food. If I ate food I was going to get fat again and then I’d have to hear comments from my parents

No.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"come on dude. this sounds like at least **1.5 decades** of an eating disorder, which required freaking *rehab*. 

I have a dad who's an alcoholic, not an abusive one or anything but it still affects me. it has affected my thinking of what a future partner should be like, scared of being an addict in the future myself but in this context, the upheaval of someone struggling with health issues in the same house is... something else together. you get nervous, anxious for your family member's wellbeing. you get scared that they're going to die relatively quicker because of their habits e.g. for my case my dad smokes and drinks (so you know what I'm talking about) 

all I'm saying is it's so redundant to just reduce the issue into ""boohoo, op doesn't want to have a fat sister as a bridesmaid"".

She is NTA for wanting someone with mental issues to not affect her wedding planning and wedding day. The fact that she is fat or not is irrelevant, it's context for what kind of mental issues the sister has.",kl5el7,gh8brdg,2020-12-27 23:02:02
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"I think I'm actually leaning NAH. My first thought was to call OP an asshole but with her edits, I feel for OP.  I've never been in OP's shoes but I have worked with special needs kids though, and I think sometimes people forget how much that impacts siblings. And I think it's okay for the sibling to want one day in their life (or even just in the year, like their birthday) that feels normal and happy to them and isn't about doing everything to make sure special sibling is okay. 

OP mentions meltdowns ""ruining"" multiple holidays (from OP's pov, at least?) and ""something as simple as someone gifting her an item of clothing caused her to break down in front of everyone."" If that is what Julia is like when she is struggling with her ED, is it a good idea to have her get fitted for matching dresses with all her slender sisters? Ect.

> And yes, of course protecting my wedding day is part of my consideration here. God forbid one single day doesn’t revolve around her I guess.  

I admit that is a selfish somewhat harsh thing to say. But I also hope we can empathize that OP says that her sister's ED has negatively impacted her life for years. That she has had many family gatherings walking on eggshells and not feeling happy as a result. And while I certainly feel bad for Julia to be going through that, I do feel bad for OP too. It must be hard to have every single family event walking on eggshells trying to not do anything that might upset Julia, or with everyone just worrying about Julia ect. And I can understand why OP would not want to spend her wedding day worrying about and catering to Julia's big emotional reactions. 

Also, OP has mental  health issues of her own including anxiety. Which has to make spending her wedding worrying about Julia having a ""meltdown"" (OP's words, not sure what she's done in the past that counts as this) harder? 

I feel this is sort of a no win situation here. I agree the kindest thing for OP to do would be to keep Julia in her wedding and then carefully tip-toe and cater all the wedding party situations to not trigger Julia. But her triggers are clothing and food, and it's a wedding, and I can understand that OP just dosen't want to have to deal with that. It sounds like having Julia in her wedding will genuinely make it less of a good experience for OP who is going to be anxious and walking on eggshells and also worries that the family as a whole will be focusing on Julia's feelings. So we're expecting OP to be kind to Julia at her own expense (having a more stressful less happy wedding) when it sounds like she feels she's already been putting Julia's emotional issues first at most of her other family events for much of her life.",kl5el7,gh86gj6,2020-12-27 22:16:15

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,I feel like the correct answer here is to discuss the concerns and ask the sister if she can handle it given the current situation. Her ED is already creeping back in with the lockdown due to unforeseen circumstances. Throw in fittings with constant measuring and being beside slender women. On top of that the bridesmaid dresses have to look good on everyone. With it likely heavily skewing to what looks good on a slim frame.  Meaning the final dress might make the sister feel ugly because it's not precisely picked out for her specifically. This could easily tip the scales. I'd ask her and let her chose. If she tries to continue on being MOH but finds it difficult she can step down at any time with sufficient notice and have a co-MOH working with her sister in case of a staff change so she picks up right where OPs sister drops off if things get serious.,kl5el7,gh84de0,2020-12-27 21:58:07

But guess what, sister may have blown off her own disorder and been like ""Oh sure! It's fine"" bc denying there's a problem is a staple of chronic relapsers. You do everything you can to cater to them and they suck the life out of you. It's sad bc you know they're victims too.

The girl keeps relapsing. It's chronic. There's nothing OP could have done. At a certain point you need to look out for yourself when someone's chronic relapsing keeps impacting you. Be there to support but it's neither reasonable nor fair for OP to have to play games over whether she's even capable of dealing with fittings and being a bridesmaid now that she's relapsing again.

The only real solution would have been eschewing the idiotic need to have everyone in matching outfits that comes with weddings.

either way the crying after is worrisome. parents should be held accountable for what they've done to us, and if they aren't aware beforehand, you letting them know does NOT make you the bad person. she's the one who shamed you into such a bad mental image you developed an ED. you did nothing but inform her of what she's done, and if she uses her crying to try and blame you for making her feel bad, she's attempting to manipulate you, and i would highly suggest you leave the household if you're able to, lest you relapse. EDs are very tricky in that they're hard to shake and if she decides you're ""too fat"" again, i'd worry about her doubling down and beginning to make comments again. i'm glad to hear you're doing better now, but sorry that your mother raised you in an environment like this. hope you're well, and you are definitely NTA NTA NTA. i wish you luck on your recovery.",k9sqo3,gf6n2r2,2020-12-09 17:03:35

"If you have a history with eating disorders, know this about ""I'm Glad My Mom Died""","(disclaimer: i’ve been in recovery for several years, i’m fine currently, and i’m speaking from experience being very online for many years in eating disorder communities)

having an eating disorder isn’t /really/ about a desire to lose weight to be beautiful - it might start that way (tho not always)… but really it’s about inflicting suffering on yourself. 

as my anorexia got worse i didn’t want to look like a supermodel. i wanted to look like a skeleton. i wanted to frighten people. the more grotesque i looked the better. i got a thrill out of hurting myself. i started wanting to destroy my body; i felt like it had betrayed me. i wanted to be a ghost. i loved the idea that people would look at me and worry for my health. you know you should stop because you’re hurting yourself but at a certain point that just… becomes the point. ed communities are full of imagery of glamorous thin celebrities but also the most harrowing fucked up images you can imagine because we’re all deeply depressed and self loathing. 

it’s also straight up addictive, and because of that, things that remind you of your ed will trigger a relapse. just one more fast day… just one more binge… then i’ll stop this time, really! and triggers around it are difficult to escape. food is inescapable, everyone displays calorie counts for every fucking thing everywhere now and diet culture is ubiquitous. i cannot “diet” - it WILL become anorexia again. i had to work really really hard to learn to ignore calories and not be sent into a spiral of self destructive behavior over glancing at a nutrition label. 

eating disorders are also wildly competitive. ed communities are full of people intentionally triggering themselves and others. my life was swallowed by those communities because comparing myself to others motivated me to do “better”. a strategy that worked was to pick a buddy and essentially compete against each other. some of the people i followed i did so because i was doing “better” than them and felt smug about it. when i watched movies and read books about it i’d be thinking “lol i’ve done worse” and then proceed to get worse.

so graphic depictions of how bad it is for you and how dangerous it is are like… yeah, that’s the point. the suffering is a feature not a bug.",yls59n,iv16qcp,2022-11-04 14:49:33

He will not be there for you during those times. 

The only reason you should be dieting is for yourself and your health. Not his crappy opinion. If you are unhealthy right now, do the healthy thing for your body and your quality of life. And starvation is never the option neither is excessive exercise.

Definitely go to HR. Making comments about what you’re eating and about your body is inappropriate and unprofessional even more so that you have asked them to stop and they have continued. Your manager isn’t bothered as long as your work is done and you tidy after yourself so they shouldn’t be either.

I remember working in an office and I happily put my headphones on so I wouldn’t have to hear diet talk. Anytime someone brought sweets in they would ask out loud if they should have some or not and they were always told to go on then. Who is going to actually say no to them without it hurting their feelings or being seen as rude?

AITA for eating a lot in front of my coworkers who are dieting? (Warning eating disorder discussion),"I remember an internship where all the other interns (most who were slimmer than me) always made comments about my Lean Cuisine microwave pizza or my ""unhealthy takeout."" 

I have ADHD. Healthy meal prep is hard and most of the time my breakfast was a packet of Belvita or something I grabbed that was just enough for me to take my meds. 

So, yeah, a lot of my calories where at lunch. I also didn't drink the super sugary Starbucks drinks they did. If you added those to their lunch meal, even my heaviest lunches were probably less calories and *more nutritious* because it was food, not sugar. 

But apparently my Diet Cokes were bad. I'm not a coffee person, so that's my caffeine. Yeah, artifical sugar isn't the best, but I don't see how a heavy cream and sugar coffee is any better. We didn't have a kettle or a good way to make tea, so keeping cokes in the fridge was easier once my morning tea ran out. 

Like *why* do people care about a stranger's food habits? Unless you suspect someone has an ED, there is no reason to even pay attention. You aren't their doctor, ffs. 

Notably, none of the detectives (it was a local pd) said a word. The department was super big into health, so most ate healthy overall, but no one gave a fuck what anyone else was eating. The most they would say is recommend local places for good food that you could quickly grab. 

I stopped eating with the other interns. The detectives knew why and would invite me to eat with them if I was the only intern in the office or the other interns weren't the toxic ones.

Edit: more ideas are welcome if anyone sees this comment. 

To hop on OP’s ideas- stress management and emotional regulation is so so important for losing weight while dealing with binge eating tendencies. Food is often a distraction from the emotions you’re trying to avoid, not feel, suppress etc. The taste, smell, texture, sight of the food distract your senses. When you’re replacing what you binge eat on.. it helps to try to make these healthy replacements as palatable as you can. I make good crunchy salad with different dressings and loads of colourful veggies. I cut up 3-4 different fruits and make a beautiful fruit bowl. I allow myself some honey, syrup with granola to indulge my senses. Coffee/decafe- smell and taste is already quite engaging for your sensory systems. With fox nuts and pop corn- you have the crunchiness to focus on. So yeah.. these are the intricacies of food, binge eating, and emotional coping.

"If you're a binge eater, continue binge eating instead of restricting. Game the system.","I have realized that this is why I and lots of others feel frustrated and unsatisfied while changing our lifestyle and losing weight. You wonder how skinny people can eat so little and be satiated and why you have to eat so much. Well it's because you are looking for that FULL feeling. You are looking to feel full and cnmpletely satiated, not just until your hunger is gone. You are chasing that content, calm feeling after a meal, but that's not what thin people or even just normal weight people do. They don't want to be in a food coma after every meal like overeaters do. They eat until their hunger is gone and no more. They only eat until they are full on special occasions like birthdays, christmas dinner, maybe the occasional fast food meal once every couple of months.

 The problem with us is that we have used food for pleasure as if it's a special occassion every day for such a long time that we don't realize that the feeling we are looking for when eating is not what we are supposed to be looking for. I don'tbelieve it is that your brain is not telling you when to stop eating. You're just not looking for those signs. You are looking for something else... which is too much pleasure. Thin people dont care about food as much as we do because they never developed this drug addiction-like habit. They dont eat to feel high. A meal is not a whole event for them. It's just someting functional they have to do to keep themselves alive. I only realized this recently and most people who have an overeating problem never realize this which is why they are constantly relapsing and falling back into bad habits. They dont understand what needs changing. They just constanly keep dieting while never feeling satisfied with their meals and always thinking about food and constantly having to dodge palatable food.

I can’t stop f****** binge eating,"When you eat, it takes a lot of energy for your stomach to digest the food. Your body has a limited amount of energy and when it comes to digesting, your body puts all its energy into this action, which means that your brain is put on hold for a while and you will think less, because your body is giving energy to another place. So if you have too much activity in your brain, digestion 'helps' to calm your brain.

It's the same for most people who stay at home on Sundays doing nothing, your body wants to move, to be active, and you have to repress this need for activity because you want to relax at home, so you eat more, to put all your organs to rest while your stomach works. And it works! But it's rubbish.

Maybe realising this will help you redirect your actions to solve the 'real problem'. But the aim would be to really calm the mind with meditation or breathing exercises, to regulate thinking, and not find another compulsive solution like eating.

Not easy, but let’s start with understanding our behaviour first and have compassion for the unconscious bad solutions we find to make ourselves feel better. Cause that’s all we’re trying to do : feel better. But let’s also leave the door open for other better solutions.",1apibd3,kq7f7d2,2024-02-13 07:51:56

For creamy and sweet snacks,  blueberries on yogurt, strawberries blended with skim milk and a little zero calorie sugar substitute or a little cottage cheese mixed with pomegranate avrils.",1km3218,ms7h0ce,2025-05-14 02:55:21

Binge eating with ADHD,"Binge eating disorder is a well-documented comorbidity of adhd. Eating fat and sugar-laden foods is like hitting the ""easy button"" for a quick dopamine fix. A ton of adhd-ers struggle this way. I look at some of my friends who don't have adhd and marvel at their apparent self-restraint in eating small portions and never going back for seconds.",1ioqnua,mclst0e,2025-02-13 19:48:30

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yes!!!! Until I got back on medication it was like there was this feral animal sitting at the back of my brain - for years! 

My first day back on meds I sat down to eat dinner. The little beasty started to rear it’s ugly head and I simply looked at the food and said “nope, not today” - the compulsion was gone. I only ate what I needed. I had all the will power in the world suddenly!

It’s not perfect and doesn’t work for everyone but I found that my medication tempered but didn’t fully stop my binging. So I started investing in other (lower to no calorie) dopamine sources! I got a soda/water carbonator (love the bubbles) and sugar free syrups (sweet treat and bubbles? Score!) as well as salty subs for things that I crave (salty crispy chickpeas or edamame are my subs for potato chips). I keep them on Amazon auto order so I don’t forget to get them lol hope this helps even a small amount fellow ADHD friend!! Much peace and love,152csat,jsdqkh4,2023-07-17 22:40:10

Edit:  First off let me say thank you all for the concern. Genuinely, thank you. Ive lived with my diagnosis for over 20 years now and Ive never had more than one person to talk to about ADHD, let alone a whole big group of them!

She is frankly a pretty messy/disorganized/forgetful person and frequently leaves the kitchen and living room (common areas) a mess with used dishware, crumbs/pieces of food on the couch, remnants all over the stove, dirty dishes in the sink for days, etc.

This reeks of severe depression to me. I know because I have severe depression and do all of these things. (Except leave crumbs because pets take care of that). Obviously she also has an eating disorder but that's not the whole story. The depression and ED are probably feeding into each other, making both worse.

I am a feminine person with hormone fluctuations, OFC I am never going to stay the ""pErFeCT"" number at all times! Even knowing that though, that number still destroyed me.

Don't go too hard on the first day, because you will feel a lot of soreness afterward and might be discouraged from going back. Pick a few workouts, make a plan, and focus on form! Consistency is the key. Its a marathon, not a sprint. Best of luck friend :) ",ax9ymt,ehs9nug,2019-03-04 18:58:37

Do you struggle with binge eating?,"I wanted to make a vent post soon, because I haven’t seen people address binge eating, only forgetting to eat. I’m glad I’m not alone, but I’m sorry you also suffer from it. 

I haven’t found a perfect solution yet, but I notice I don’t binge/ binge less when I force myself to have a good breakfast. I also try to eat a lot of protein and fiber because those satiate you longer than carbs (and also because I want to build more muscle in the gym).",ognru5,h4k0mhv,2021-07-09 04:11:06

My binge eating was bad before I was on meds, but now I take meds Monday-Friday I eat really healthy in the week, then it’s an all out binge at the weekend (no meds Saturday and Sunday).

Each Sunday evening I tell myself that it’s the last time I will do a weekend binge, but I’ve done one every weekend, or at least one of the days, for about 4 months. It’s really annoying as it ruins the hard work in the week of exercising and diet. It also doesn’t help that I will go out drinking Friday or Saturday, so the next day i’m hungover which makes it hard to get out the house and avoid binging",ognru5,h4kmnin,2021-07-09 09:10:56
Would you say something to another mom if her kid binge-eating sweets during playdates?,"There could be a lot of things going on here. I've known kids with very restrictive parents who were NEVER allowed to have sweets at home, so all that happened is that instead of developing a healthy relationship with food, they learned to sneak the ""bad"" stuff and they'd gorge on it at any opportunity. On the other hand one of my kids also had a friend who was very poor, and he'd raid my pantry any time he came over. He wasn't on a sugar rush, he was just hungry. I told that kid he could eat anything he wanted. 

Severe sugar cravings can also be a sign of a medical condition, so I wouldn't necessarily keep this a secret from the parents, but considering that other things might be at play, I'd tread really carefully here. Start by talking to the kid and trying to feel it out. It can be something as simple as, ""How often do you get candy at your house? I want to make sure I'm not breaking your mom's rules.""

If you need a reason, maybe just say, you want to let the girls have some sweets next time and wanted to see what was allowed/what the girl liked. 

I have almost always treated sweets as a regular food. We didn’t make it extra special. If they wanted one piece, they got it. I’d give them their cookie with their dinner. They still will occasionally get a sweet tooth and sneak a few extra pieces. That’s usually right after a candy holiday bc it’s all new and exciting.

Would you say something to another mom if her kid binge-eating sweets during playdates?,"I second this 100%. My 9yo daughter has had friends that showed behaviors exactly like what OP describes, and it was because their parents were so called ""health nuts"" who demonized sugar as ""bad for you"" and didn't allow them to have candy or any kind of sweets in the house unless for special occasions like Halloween. So they gorged on it the rare occasions they were allowed to have it and when they were at someone else's house, and were known to sneak and hide things too. I'm going to be really surprised if they don't end up with eating disorders in a few years. My mom wasn't as extreme but placed a lot of shame around eating sweets to the point I would do similar things (eat it when she wasn't around to tell me I was going to gain weight for everything), and it definitely messed up my self image and relationship with food. NGL, I would have *hated* it if my friend's parents had told her about ""unhealthy"" food I ate at their houses because it would have just given her more ammunition. 

I definitely agree to tread carefully and do this exact thing of asking the kid first, because if this sneaking and gorging behavior is because of overly restrictive  and/or abusive parents, she could face repercussions at home.",1jzclht,mn5giz3,2025-04-14 23:59:06

Would you say something to another mom if her kid binge-eating sweets during playdates?,"Why not? 

Like genuinely, why not eat a cookie *with* dinner? What is the issue? (I can definitely see why “instead of” is an issue, but “with”? 

Like is it just because it doesn’t gel with what your construct of what “dinner” looks like? So you just “shouldn’t” ?

This method is based on research by Ellyn Satter called division of responsibility feeding and the purpose is to “normalise” treats to help kids learn to better understand their hunger and satiety cues - including stuff like a healthy approach to treat food. 

I know plenty of adults who say stuff like “well the cookie was there so I *had* to eat it!” Without actually listening to if their body wants it or not. Most likely these adults grew up with treats being limited so they don’t have a great approach to managing treat food. This happens because the treat food is restricted so human nature is to want it even more. 

It’s worth looking into the methodology and research to get a better understanding of why this might be a method worth perusing https://www.ellynsatterinstitute.org",1jzclht,mn5clqu,2025-04-14 23:36:22

Two other things that really helped me with after-dinner eating:

 - go for a walk (not possible for everyone but a great new habit and breaking the temptation by literally walking away from your pantry really helps)

 - intsead of thinking of some treat or food and struggling with telling myself "" NO- you cant eat that"" I tell myself ""YES- you CAN eat that - *tomorrow*, for breakfast. you can eat whatever you want, tomorrow, for breakfast."" so it's not a ""no"" it's a ""yes, but after your nap."" The only thing I have to do before I can eat whatever I want is sleep. easy, right?

How on Earth do you stop binge eating for comfort when you are depressed?,"I found 'The Binge Code' by Alison Kerr helpful.

I eat when I'm fighting my feelings. I'm trying to learn how to be with them but I fucking hate them. In recent months I started to relapse (alcohol) and realized quick that I needed to start reaching out for help. So I pick up the phone instead of food. It helps me to let someone distract me long enough to get out of my head and let the shitty feelings diminish. When I can't reach anyone I cry and journal, even if all I can write is ""This is so stupid"" x500.  

I had been powerlifting for 4 yrs to help with emotional release. It was super helpful to keep anxiety & depression at bay. But like everything, I pushed too hard, got burnt out, life happened, covid ruined everything & I turned back to food. 

With the recent wake-up call I've redoubled my efforts to get comfortable with being uncomfortable, stop eating my feelings and get back in the gym. I'm a few kg from my competition weight, and being under the bar is the best worst time I can imagine having =D I feel like hell, but my head & heart are clear and light.

How on Earth do you stop binge eating for comfort when you are depressed?,"If food is the only thing that brings you joy, you can’t take that away and not expect your life to collapse. You have to swap something in to prop it up. Is there anything you REALLY enjoy doing? Drawing, reading, exercising, video games, writing, journaling, any type of hobby? Something you really get lost in? This is your opportunity to let yourself get fully invested in that. Any time you feel like you want to binge, immediately substitute it with something you really love. You can also write down 5 things you’re grateful for when you get an urge. 

Addiction impulses come from not having enough stimulation and feeling shame and hopelessness. But it’s really hard to understand that when you’re stuck in it. Good luck!",r0kjo7,hlt7vxg,2021-11-23 20:20:24

How on Earth do you stop binge eating for comfort when you are depressed?,"I tell myself ""not today"". It's not never, it's just me saying out loud that I don't want that today, it helps cultivate self control and actually feels kinda good knowing that I'm not a slave to my low mood.

Every time that low mood strikes ""not today"".

Another useful trick is to think about how you're feeling right now, if you know you're just feeling low you can verbalise it. ""I don't really want that, I'm just feeling low right now and that will just make me feel worse"".

It's hard sometimes and eventually you may give in but even if you just stop yourself doing it every other time, it is still a victory you can build on until you are truly the master of what you really want. Best of luck! I believe in you!",r0kjo7,hltmjmg,2021-11-23 21:56:31

"I don't like people telling me ""It's okay to have one cheat day"" and trying to pressure me into binge eating.","For me, the idea of “let’s have a cheat day!” is more of a “c’mon, don’t be responsible because that’ll remind me that I should be responsible and make me feel bad.” Being a lifelong fat person, I’ve always been surrounded by people who leaned on me to justify their own indulgence or depended on me to do things like split appetizers with them (“I can’t eat all that by myself…you just gotta have some to help me with it!”) to keep them from feeling wasteful. I had to start to be fierce in protecting my boundaries around food and my intake. My husband is the type to say something like “c’mon, there isn’t much left, let’s just finish this” and I had to learn to be super firm in only eating what I wanted to eat. I’m full when I say I am, period. My diet/eating pattern/preferred intake is not up for debate, it’s not there to make anyone else comfortable, it’s not going to be decided by anyone other than me, PERIOD. DOT. End of sentence. If I want a cheat meal/day, it’ll be because I decided to have it, not anyone else. If I want a bite that’s been offered to me, I’ll accept it, but it’s my choice, not theirs. 

One of my dietary commandments is this: *I will not eat out of obligation any longer.* 

It’s actually been very liberating. I never realized how often I was eating things in my house to run out leftovers, for example, or because my mother in law gave us a bag of snacks that we opened but that no one else wanted to eat. 

My language has changed as well - there’s nothing I *can’t* have, but there’s a lot of stuff I just *don’t* or *won’t* eat because I value myself more. I’m eating better for me because I deserve better. It’s been super empowering.",u01ipn,i43hfc7,2022-04-09 23:23:14

I honestly don’t know if any would recommend calorie counting to someone with an ED. If someone is able to remedy the emotional reasons of binge eating, then they will be able to lose weight without focusing on their intake by way of no longer binge eating.

Mental health professionals also will tailor what they say to clients to keep if helpful, they hold back A LOT. Perhaps this one didn’t want to add an extra layer of guilt that the effects of binge eating are potentially causing health issues because they thought it might cause more harm.

Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"A lot of good advice here to consider.  This will probably be buried beneath all the comments but I will say I was in the exact same situation as you a few months ago.  Binging and constant overeating, so I sought a nutritionist that specializes in eating disorders.  She told me the same thing - stop tracking.  Stop trying stupid fasts so I could ""eat more at dinner"" and trying to convince myself that wasn't just a hidden excuse to binge.  Stop completely obsessing about *every single calorie* in *every single bite of food* during the morning and afternoon, only to become fatigued with the decisions by the evening, throw in the towel and become **The Eatbeast**.  

The way she explained intuitive eating to me was this; it's not just about say, eating half a chocolate cake because I want it and crave it.  Sure, give in to the craving and have a slice of cake because nothing is truly off limits.  But it's also taking a step back and trying to tune into my body - did I get enough protein today?  Enough water?  Enough insert-macro-here?  Intuitive eating is also about what is serving your body properly and learning to recognize what it needs.  She said CICO absolutely works - for those who do not have eating disorders.  The people without eating disorders know they just have to scale back and don't give it nearly as much thought as ED patients.  

Did I also roll my eyes and secretly vow to conquer binge eating *and* lose weight at the same time?  *Absolutely.*  Did it actually work?  That's a big fat *fuck no it did not*.  

So I let go.  I temporarily deleted the tracking apps off my phone and focused on getting enough protein during my day as well as enough water.  Hydration has always been an issue with me, I have suspicions I am part camel.  Trust me, it definitely sucked at first.  I was anxious as hell about just *not knowing* how much I was consuming.  So much so in fact, I naturally scaled back my portions.  I ate my protein, drank my water... I also had my chocolate cake.  And reese's.  And salad.  And pasta.  And whatever I wanted.

6 weeks into this whole lame not tracking bullshit, I hopped on the scale.  6.8 pounds down.  Oh.  Um... *hm*.  I guess the Registered Dietician does know more than Eatbeast Exogen.",pym9qr,hewe1u7,2021-09-30 21:21:01

If this is true why did you post here? You've got a lot of people telling you to reconsider in this thread. Why expose yourself to that if you were entirely convinced?

Speaking of convincing here's my story:

I've had Binge Eating Disorder since I was 10. I topped out at 365, which was the weight I was at two years ago when I finally took the scary step of moving away from fad diets, counting calories, and restrictive eating towards something akin to IE. I mean it when I say it was scary -- I felt the same way you do. Right up until the day I did it I had been trying on and off for two years to complete a potato only fast. I'd got a couple days and then binge. 

I never went to a binge eating therapist, but I read enough to know what they'd suggest. So, I went to the store and bought a bunch of ingredients and foods I'd developed phobias around: meat, cheese, sugar, flour, peanut butter. I also got lots of fruits and veggies and grains and legumes. 

I only had one rule: If I wanted to eat it I was going to make it myself.

Over the next year I tried to not count calories or macros. Turns out that undoing that habit felt as difficult as undoing my binge eating. It felt unsafe to just eat what I wanted when I was hungry. But I did it, and turns out it worked when I let it.

To skip to the end I will reveal I lost 105 lbs in a year. I went from 365 to 260. It was not a linear path -- there were many hiccups along the way. But it was not with what I ate, it was with how I approached food. 


When I didn't count or track it became much easier to listen to my body. Did I still overeat sometimes? You bet! But you know what? I began to realize what made me feel bad and I adjusted my eating. I realized too much peanut butter made me feel heavy and bloated so I cut back. I realized having dried fruit in the house led to late night snacking, so I made sure I only bought fresh fruit. If I Really wanted some raisins or something I bought a small package on the day I bought groceries, as a treat.

I began to feel better both physically and mentally, but it was still a struggle.

There were times when I went back to weighing myself twice a day and counting calories because I didn't ""FEEL"" like I was losing weight. Why? Well losing weight was suppose to feel hard. It didn't feel hard, so I must be doing something wrong. When I began to repeat those behaviors I began to gain weight; because with them came the binging. I came to see how binging was a direct result of my dieting behaviors.

At the end of the year I moved to a new situation with more stressors, and with those stressors the urge to engage in dieting behavior re-emerged. Long story short, I gave up on the intuitive eating and I gained all the weight back. 

I'm back where I started physically and mentally. The fear, surprisingly, returned about dropping the dieting behavior. My mother had OCD and I'm aware now that my dieting behavior may have an OCD component to it. I'm working on easing myself back into intuitive eating, because it's the only thing that worked for me and made me feel good at the same time.

You were correct when you said only you can ""save you"" in so far as you have to make the decisions, but if you stubbornly cling to ideas that haven't work for you my view is you're going to remain stuck. I found that to be true in my life. 

My hope for you is that you'll take the risk and explore another way, at least for a time. The results may surprise you. 

Best of luck on your journey.",pym9qr,hew3ikg,2021-09-30 20:03:37
Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"An ED specialist will be advising you on treating the ED and the typical treatment for EDs is to handle the psychological hang-ups on food. Not tracking food is a normal part of the therapy, no matter which ED you have. 

If you don't want to continue with that therapist, I'd talk to a nutritionist. Cutting out sugar and reducing carbs really helped me control the bingeing urges so maybe that would help you.",pym9qr,hev7deb,2021-09-30 16:20:37
Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"Totally agreed. I tried to combat my binge eating disorder with calorie restriction, without even realizing that I had gone too far in the opposite direction. And then I’d fail, because I wasn’t really treating my BED, I was just trying to shove past it and lose weight, because I assumed that losing weight would solve my mental health issues. So I’d get stressed again and… I’d binge. BED is usually much more about solving the emotional problems behind binge eating, and once you solve that intense need to binge in Act I, weight loss is part of Act II. A therapist once explained it to me like this: you have to treat and stop one way of acting before you can enact another, otherwise you’re not healing an unhealthy behavior, you’re just smothering it until next time.",pym9qr,hew69a4,2021-09-30 20:24:09
Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"I think she is trying to get you in tune with your body and what it needs. Taking the pressure off regarding weight loss can break your binge cycles and get in touch with what your body tells you. I think that’s why she is recommending you don’t count calories. I am recovered from an eating disorder myself (bulemia) and can confirm it worked to break the binging. You probably need to stop trying to lose weight until you are confident you have conquered this eating disorder. I also recommend you see a therapist specializing in eating disorders, because binging is a coping mechanism that can be broken with CBT.",pym9qr,hevp0ib,2021-09-30 18:22:08
Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"exactly this!

Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"One thing to keep in mind is the relationship between restricting and binging. For a lot of people binging is a reaction to feeling overly restricted, and so while it may seem counterintuitive stopping restrictions can be the first step towards stopping the binges. It may not mean this is the approach forever, but that it’s a step she feels is helpful at the start of treatment. Like when your car spins out and you actually need to steer into it to get control back and keep the wheel from locking up.",pym9qr,hev8uxb,2021-09-30 16:30:45
Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"I successfully lost weight on a very restrictive diet. Basically same breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day for months on end. Though this worked for my weight loss goals, I didn't learn how not to binge, and I quickly regained the weight. Breaking the cycle of shame and loss of control requires totally re-configuring your relationship to food. Understanding food as bad or good, high calorie or low calorie, only adds to the unhealthy relationship with food that's at the heart of binge eating. I always blamed the cake or the cookies or the ice cream, but binge eating isn't an external problem, its internal, and often it will require lots of therapy to overcome it.

The best advice I ever received was to compile as many healthy coping mechanisms as possible. I started working out 4 times a week, going for long walks with my dog, reading, taking a bath, cooking a fun meal, drawing, you name it. Once I started doing these other things to relieve stress, it became much easier to avoid binges.",pym9qr,hevu5wz,2021-09-30 18:57:43
Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"OP, I am by no means an expert, and I make sure to make that clear to clients that I work with that have histories of ED. But I am a bodybuilding/general population nutrition coach, and I have seen massive success overcoming BED with many many clients by actually removing all tracking/restrictions. It seems counterintuitive to weight loss, but if removing the “rules” temporarily results in less binging, it actually tends to result in weight loss. Give it a shot. And once you have your BED under control, then go back to tracking, but make sure to start yourself really high calorie wise and reduce them as slowly as possible to ensure you don’t fall back into the over-restricting/binging/guilt cycle.",pym9qr,hevunf7,2021-09-30 19:01:08

Binge-eating disorder (only late at night) - what worked for you guys?,"You have developed some bad habits. Some behavior modification is in order. You can see a professional if it you can't fix it yourself. Suggestions:

&#x200B;

1. Go to sleep earlier and get up earlier. Sounds simple, but it worked for me.
2. Eat a little more during your regular meals, especially protein.
3. Binge on healthy food. I switched to a salad or some carrots. Or an egg. 2 eggs and a piece of toast have the same number of calories as a chocolate bar, and you feel full and get a lot more nutrients.
4. Brush your teeth immediately after dinner.
5. Don't buy any junk/binge food. When you look in your pantry there will be nothing to binge on and you will give up.

When you are working out a lot you definitely get hunger cravings. It always happens to me when I use >1500 cal in a single workout.  A few (1/2 oz) of almonds or nuts really seems to slow it down half way through the workout.

I find that for whatever reason - maybe because it’s not wheat flour or white sugar - I have my treat or whatever and I’m good and I can move on and I don’t want more.

If she wents through the troubles to smuggle their triggers to an addict-in-recovery , and says ""you deserve a break"" , just saying nicely No won't work.
Panicking and having her removed by the security was the best option, as she clearly wouldn't be the one stopping herself from bringig their TRIGGERS TO AN ADDICT.

And I would be very cautious when you go out of the program. If she is trying to sabotage you while you are in your program, chances are she would try the same after you got home.

This is such a serious issue for you to have and you seem to be at a point where you are making real change. For her to act like it's no big deal is minimizing the challenge you are dealing with.

AITAH for reporting my wife for bringing me snacks in the hospital?,"This isn't necessarily true. I've had/have an ED.

A lot of people, if they can't understand it they won't just accept the professionals or individuals reality, they'll fight about it and assume they are exaggerating or being dramatic. That the person with an ED just needs to try harder. It's anecdotal, but this is a slightly more for common response than actually accepting someone has a serious issue with something that is absolutely needed to survive.

I didn’t find out until I was down to 105 and vomiting every day as I went through chemo that he wanted me fat and not thin, despite me struggling to lose weight constantly because I’m tiny and a few extra pounds looks like a lot on me.

It seems clear that P&M are just dead set on getting only their way no matter how much it discomfits or imposes on the rest of the group. That’s certainly not in the congenial, inclusive spirit of the group you have nurtured.

If the latter, it’s interesting to me that she’s then seemingly flipped to the other side even though she witnessed how difficult & health-impacting your journey was. 

What I’m asking, I guess, is if Polly seems to enjoy the dominant role of enabling, which can definitely have an inclusive/accepting aspect but which also tends to cement the dependency of the feedee upon the enabler. You mentioned that Polly was very lonely & likely compelled by the desire to keep her new partner at any cost & so perhaps this dynamic serves Polly because enabling will foster Melissa’s dependence upon her (albeit at the cost of her own health in the long run).",1ixi4ix,memkknu,2025-02-25 01:35:05

You say she tells you you're being manipulative but it's actually HER that's manipulating you into giving her her fix. You are essentially killing her with kindness and this can't continue.

I'm telling you OP, if you don't start denying your wife food, she is going to die from her weight and you are going to wish you had done something sooner.

I'm not trying to be horrible or disrespectful but it is the truth. Please for the love of god stop this now.

Wishing you and your wife the absolute best moving forwards ❤️",1jcsizd,mi5dd94,2025-03-16 20:39:51

How can I help her see I'm serious and salvage this?","You are going to need to watch every episode of My 600 Pound life and start imitating Dr Now.  

Change all the  debit and credit card numbers so she stops ordering food. Don’t allow enablers who would bring her junk food to come around.

Only keep healthy high protein options in the house. She isn’t doing the shopping so she has no say.

Don’t allow your children to become her care givers in their preteens (memories or having to clean my mom up and having to change the wraps on her legs haunt me and my brothers)

Have a real talk about her having to live in a facility if she doesn’t make some serious changes. 

I will say, none of this worked for my mom. My mom died a year ago at well over 600 pounds. Food addiction is real.  She was working up until a fall left her bed bound and then once she couldn’t walk she ended up in a nursing facility. The sad part is her dad was that weight and a few aunts and uncles are close or right behind. By the time my mom was willing to try gastric bypass she wasn’t a candidate.

My mom was hospitalized at one point because she had a damn feeding tube and wouldn’t stop eating. It was really sad. She signed a piece of paper saying she understood the risk and released the nursing home of liability because she was on a liquid diet for tube feeding, but she kept ordering door dash in the nursing home. When she didn’t have access to credit or debit cards, she would barter or sell her stuff to others in the nursing home in order to get cash to give to others to order her food.  She started paying someone to buy ingredients to make her food and she’d have it in her mini fridge. Ended up with botulism then sepsis. All over damn food.

The reality is, unless she can get her own food, you’ve got some control here. Is she orders it to be delivered, she can’t have it if she can’t get up and get it, otherwise she eats what you put in front of her. My mom died young for no other reason than she couldn’t stop eating. And what’s crazy is my mom didn’t get to her worst until she was in her 50s when it was harder to move the weight around, she worked a full time job at over 500 pounds at a store, 40 hours a week. Even then she was on the fast track to an early grave. But she always said she was working full time so no one could say anything about her being fat and lazy, and that her dad was that weight. Your wife is only 34 where my mom was at 50. At this trajectory she’ll be dead in the next 15 years.",1jcsizd,mi50vpg,2025-03-16 19:37:36

Ozempic, and others have cards to help people afford it plus there's compound pharmacies that have it more affordably. And even prescription mail delivery programs. 

Put your foot down. Therapy, effort and being responsible for her addiction is all part of the conversation. She's got to die if she keeps it up. Ask her point blank of she wants her kids finding her dead from eating one day in the near future. That's what's gonna happen. Maybe since she cannot do her own care she needs a facility to help her get herself under control. Honestly the 20 lbs lost isn't that impressive and probably shows she was overeating even with the meds. She needs help beyond what you can provide. And possibly bariatric but without getting her addiction under control and therapy it'd be a waste as she'd only undo it within a year or two.",1jcsizd,mi59jnb,2025-03-16 20:20:40

It is impossible to continue on this way without doing yourself serious and lasting harm.  

Weight loss is complicated but it’s also not the only way to approach improvement here.  Mobility and mental health would be the two things I would focus on.  I do think that an ultimatum *that you will stick to* should be on the table.  Don’t put it out there unless you’re willing to back it up.  It would be completely reasonable to demand a return to therapy (once the insurance issue is sorted) and that she participate in a family walk/gentle physical activity (hell, play corn hole. anything that requires her to stand and move) every day.

But can I give wake up call? You are also part of the problem by enabling her.

Park the car as far from the door as you can. At least 100 lb of her weight was gained because of the coddling you have done.

How can I help her see I'm serious and salvage this?","I've been 550+lbs (268kg) at my heaviest.  I know exactly what it feels like to be the unhealthy partner,  and a mother that cannot function effectively due to the immense impact such a large weight has on physical and mental health,  as well as social and professional connections. 

You're in a terrible position because there are many layers to what you're experiencing.  

You're basically functioning as a single parent as well as a carer. 

You're also a financial provider and executive assistant in the home. 

You're human and you're own person,  but you're also part of a romantic couple that is meant to be a partnership. 

Your social life as an independent human,  as a couple,  and as a parent is deeply impacted.  

I can absolutely see why you're at breaking point.  This is far too much for one human to handle for any length of time.  You should be extremely proud of yourself for getting as far as you have and still wanting to help your wife.  

But I'm going to be very honest with you.  

You are drowning.  

You have financial instability due to current work status.  

You have children that need to be taken care of as a priority. 

You need to put your oxygen mask on first.  The children need to have a stable home,  stable resources,  and at least one effective,  engaged,  and loving parent.  

You cannot save her from herself.  I say this as someone who could not be saved.  This is an extended,  extreme situation that you've tried to address repeatedly and you now are at breaking point.  Your energy must be spent on the children and on yourself *first.*

You cannot save everyone under the current circumstances. The second your wife decides she wants to be part of a solution,  part of the future of the family, that's when you work *together* to find solutions and overcome barriers to help get help and be supported. 

You need to focus on therapy for yourself,  look into enablement, and decide what your own future and the children's future needs to look like first.  Ideally,  your wife will be included and will take the steps to work on her ability to be part of the family and be a responsible parent.  

I'm 42F and my daughter is about to turn 21. She's thriving, and she must take credit because I absolutely failed her in terms of being physically present,  social with her circle,  attending school events,  having fun and sharing the world with her for almost a decade.  I totally and utterly fucked up and am living with that legacy of our relationship and my current health.

Worst, I let my partner and daughter live in fear that I would die from my morbid obesity and my resulting physical and mental health conditions.   It is my single biggest regret of my entire life.  

Others here may help you with ideas to support her - I hope that what I've said will help reframe your role in this.    

She must save herself,  that's a decision she must make.  There is nothing you can do to make that decision for her.  You can support her and have that discussion with her,  and stop buying her food.  Let her get upset.  Let her get her own food.  Serve food that is nourishing for your family.  

Therapy,  no further enabling (once you have therapy), help from therapist to have that heavy conversation with her,  and first and foremost protect yourself and your children so that they have a stable life where their own needs are met.

The odds of her success without therapy are low. It’s ok for a relationship to end and flow, and sometimes with a disability or disease there is an unbalanced dynamic. But she is capable of so much more and her ‘disease’ can be treated and cured with the right help and effort on her part. It’s time for her to show up in your relationship and put in the equal work to participate and take the burden off of you.

Ask her current therapist or her PCP/GP for referrals and suggestions. Binge eating is an addiction and she will need a ton of willpower to overcome the urges long-term. She needs to treat her depression. not to numb her feelings with food and generally re-learn her relationship with food.

While she can't do a glp-1 inhibitor at this time, there are often medical programs for losing weight, including pills that can be taken orally. They're not long-term solutions, she absolutely needs to curb the overarching issues, but targeted therapy is the place to start.

It is amazing how strong the desire to stress eat is,"This definitely registers as someone who has binged since childhood.

For me, stress eating caused my weight to yo-yo over the years, but what led to me becoming overweight was the mindset that I spent all day taking care of everyone else, so I *deserve* this treat. I had to really shift my idea of what I deserve (health, happiness, feeling comfortable in my own skin), as well as be more assertive in my day-to-day life and carve out time for myself so I didn't feel resentful or helpless.",mgedt1,gssosm2,2021-03-30 13:10:44

I guess it's just eating when your nervous at all, either because something unexpectedly good happened or something that was downright awful happened, either way it would usually throw my food-tracking out of whack :(

I eventually got it under control by finding something cathartic for me to do instead, which turned out to be watching horror movies or horror gameplay while exercising. I like watching stuff with other people, but horror is one genre that nobody I know well seems to like, so doing it while exercising was a great way to get two birds with one stone. Also, when I get jumpscared my biking intensity goes higher. It's a great way to let off Steam and switch off while doing something healthy for my body and also working through my ginormous backlog of horror games and movies to peruse.",mgedt1,gssq7ro,2021-03-30 13:23:36

Stress eating anyone?,"I struggle with this too. Usually my mentality goes, “It’s been stressful and I’ve worked hard or put up with enough BS that at the end of the day, I deserve a shit ton of ice cream.” 

The issue is not that I need to unwind, but that *food* is the way I reward myself—and this is common for lots of us, and it’s partially ingrained when we’re kids and our parents let us get a candy bar for behaving at the grocery store. We learn early on that food is a reward for good behavior. 

What I’m trying to do is make other things a reward, especially a fitness-related one. On a day I want to eat all the dessert, I decide to reward myself instead with a new lip balm or something else small, or I can give myself a “point”. I can then get new workout leggings/bra/shirt when I get to 5 points (or 10, or whatever is reasonable for the cost of the item). It is delayed gratification but I’m trying to train myself to have more tangible things that will last longer than a snack as a reward. I also use points on a weekend massage after a hard workout week and it is worth it!

I had the pleasure of enjoying the best tiramisu of my life while in Italy once and the thing that made it stand out from all others, was a super-thin layer of dark chocolate within the dessert. It was almost as thin as a chocolate shaving, but thick enough to not melt into the other layers. It created this wonderful delicate momentary crunch that offset the softness of the desert, and the bitterness of the dark chocolate offset the overall sweetness of the dessert. I’m going to add that layer next time I make this. Maybe just drizzle in some melted semisweet or dark chocolate between two of the chilled layers.  Happy baking!",1hjrvq7,m3bombz,2024-12-22 19:18:16

I don't have answers, clearly...but I will share an epiphany. I'm in a different phase of my life than you are and it's taken this much time (and hours of therapy) to understand that my weight gain is not about the food. I eat to self-soothe. It's the same reason I became addicted to alcohol (660 days sober today!). I had a traumatic and damaging childhood and eating gave me joy. Sometimes it was the only joy. And in that way, overeating is a trauma response. 

But I am not the same person anymore. And I am working through that trauma and if I can quick alcohol, I *know* I can quit unhealthy eating. I just need to keep trying. 

There are reasons you overeat, and I promise you...it isn't lack of willpower or any type of character flaw. There are honest-to-goodness reasons and discovering those reasons is the key.",lqx48f,goj3e5a,2021-02-24 00:57:56

Not sure why the link is wonky, but here's the comment in full from [psychedelic666](https://www.reddit.com/user/psychedelic666/): 

""I always drop this quote bc it is 100% accurate. It captures exactly what you are talking about perfectly.

“To say that straight men are heterosexual is only to say that they engage in sex (fucking exclusively with the other sex, i.e., women). All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men. The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire… those are, overwhelmingly, other men. In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal. From women they want devotion, service and sex.

Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving.”

For starters, you are living in an extremely dysfunctional situation, where the father keeps all the nutritious food for himself, under lock and key. The mother, just as hungry as you are, steals your food, gives phony excuses, and when called out, starts bawling. (Note: people who do the wrong thing and start crying in self-defense when confronted are *always* a-holes.) She makes a big show of going to get you your food, but ends up not going. Your father -- who is starving her along with you and your sister -- screams at you and takes away her keys *so she couldn't go get you your food.* If you are a minor, call CPS on them for starving you.

I totally agree with you. You bought that food for yourself. And your mother is being shitty. She did this to your sister as well.

Sadly, as long as you live with your mother, there is not much you can do. She has the power to punish you or kick you out, so you don't have the power to set boundaries or show anger. :(

The biggest problem is your father. If he wouldn't keep all the decent food for himself, your mother would be able to get a good meal and wouldn't feel the need to do this. Your mother did this out of desperation because your father is an arsehole.",1ccambx,l1459vg,2024-04-24 22:25:55

Basic etiquette. Everyone gets a serving on first round that wants one. If any is left over, seconds can be had one piece at a time to whomever wants one but thirds and further repeat the seconds rule. If a guest breaks this rule they don’t get invited back without an apology.

First thanksgiving, I made 2 pecan pie. Everyone had seconds almost immediately and not a crumb is left. I’m feeling pretty good about myself, but also sad that I didn’t have my left over slice the next morning with coffee. Second thanksgiving, I make 4 pies - no way there won’t be left overs! Time for dessert and four family members go up to two pies and cut them into halves, put them into containers, and then into their purses. Then go back and get their large slice from the other two.  Leaving maybe 1 pie worth for the rest of the family. I didn’t even get a slice, let alone left overs. Now I make a whole pie for myself that stays home and 1 pie for the family.

AITAH for Not Serving as Much Food as I Know My Dinner Guests Will Want to Eat? [Concluded],"The description in the first post was jaw-dropping on its own; thinking back on it after reviewing the recipe for that lasagna made it so much worse. Holy cow. I mean, a 9x13 pan of an ordinary lasagna would be a hell of a lot of food for one person, but a 9x13 pan of OOP's 14-layer lasagna is a whole different ball game. According to her recipe, just one lasagna incorporates 2,000 mL (so, about 8½ cups) of the various meat sauces and 1,500 mL (about 6⅓ cups) of the ricotta cheese sauce – and that's before you add the 500 grams (1.1 lbs) of shredded mozzarella and two balls of fresh mozzarella to top it off! That is – I don't even know how to describe what that is. But it's definitely far, far more than one person should eat over the course of multiple days, let alone at one sitting.

1. He might apologize for making a scene if he thinks it'd help, but not for the actual words, which were justified.

2. He should stand by and repeat that this was the culmination of ten years of bullying by the sister, abetted by the parents.

3. He might point out that she's much older than he was when she started bullying him, so no definition of ""she's younger"" can justify her actions.  Either she's old enough to take it in now (and too old to dish it out) or he was too young to be expected to take it in before.

ETA 4. He might want to direct some portion of his communication at his stepsister alone.  That way he can point out that the ""She's much younger"" comments mean that her mother refuses to see her as an adult (or responsible for her actions), even at age 20, and that's a problem for everyone.

No, it isn't, you have the benefits wrong, see the links below they're damn near identical and from separate world renowned leading health professionals.

It's the proven method for fighting treatment resistant epilepsy (especially in children) and shows other neurological promise.

However, No leading health institution claims anything other than short term and mixed results using it to lose weight, they flat out state that while it works well for some it's been shown multiple times not to be safe or effective for other people regardless of underlying health conditions.

Longterm (life long) results in every link below are stated as unknown because the studies out their fall short.

She may also prefer an exercise cycle or an elliptical.  Both are very good machines, and a cycle has the extra benefit of possibly turning into a tv or gaming seat.

Maybe you should stop offering her your food that you then eat anyway, after apologizing for dicking her around so many times.

How to stop stress eating processed food?,"I was/am in a similar boat. The best advice I can give is to not buy the crappy processed stuff to keep in the house. If you can order groceries online for pick up it’s a lot easier than walking down the isle and throwing those snacks in the cart. Also, deleting all saved credit card info from any pizza/ubereats/grubhub type things on your phone/computer. Make it as hard as possible for you to actually order the junk food. 

As far as not having energy to cook. I suggest learning to make an easy meal like grilled/baked chicken breasts and sautéed veggies. You can always change the seasoning and veggies enough to mix up the flavors. If you’re making that 5/6 meals a week then you’re already eating healthy 1/3 of the time.

There have been cases on here where someone swaps something out or puts something in someone’s food without their knowledge, or to “test” an allergy, or to trick them into eating something they claim they don’t like. 

This is not the case with your situation. He said you could both stand to eat healthier (“make a change”), and swapping out high-carb, calorie-dense foods with healthy equivalents is literally Healthy Eating 101. 

I mean...

What did he expect you to do? Like you said, there were no complaints until he actually realized you were swapping out foods. Assuming he has no aversions and no allergies, you’re right: he’s being a fucking child. If he wants to bitch about the food that you make (without any of his help, apparently) then he gets to make his own meals. 

The fact that he didn’t even know you were substituting foods shows how much he contributes to your meal prep. Good on you for not giving in to his tantrum. He’s a grown up (at least in age). He is perfectly capable of making himself food, or even driving his own self to get takeout.

I'm a clinical psychologist and can share my personal understanding on this, some of which has already been stated by others in the replies, some of which might be a new input.


As many might already know, the state of flow is coneptualized as more or less equivalent ballance of personal ability and difficulty of the task. You can skip the following example if you're already familiar with the princip. Say for example you're a boxer, have been training for about 2 years now and your first fight is coming up. Should the oponent be of roughly the same weight, age and skill as you, the difficulty for you both will be high enough that it demands your full attention. However the skill of the opponent might not be too much higher than yours, so that you feel overwhelmed during the figh. In the optimal scenario both of you become so immersed, without being depressed or frustrated, that you blend out everything around you, even time and fight to your full potential. Easy enough to understand I hope. Now should your opponent be a lot more experienced, say 5 years into training, the difficulty of the task will take up more of your attention and energy than you can handle. You might become frustrated, irritated, hopeless and in the end you won't be able to enter the tunnel of flow. Same goes for when the opponent is way weaker, the task becomes so easy that your brain will not deem it worthy of your full attention. And though you will probably win, entering the flow tunnel will probably not happen in this scenario either, since your brain will be bored, have too much room for other thoughts and stimuli. I hope that wasn't too wordy.

With that in mind, let's look at video games. Say you start playing pokemon for the first time, just as an example. The game is new, but the single steps to understanding it are probably not too difficult to comprehend. You learn how to catch pokemon, how to fight, how to level, etc. If the game happens to be around your level of skill you will lose track of time and be immersed in it. However if it happens to be your 20th playthrough, you might start with enthusiasm, yet lose interest 2 hours in because the difficulty is far to low for you, no challenges exist and so you are just strolling by. You might still keep playing (I will get to that in a moment), but you won't enter flow state. Same goes of course once again for when you play a game that is too hard for you. Online games are the easiest examples of this. Whenever I try to play Battlefield or CoD online at my friend's place I stop about 5 minutes into the round, simply because I do not even understand where I'm getting shot at from or where the enemies even are. Therefore, no flow state for me either. 

Games, just like drugs (albeit fairly weaker, depending on the drug of course) have another ace up their sleeve however. The reward. With the flow state, the result is not always of importance, sometimes not at all. If an artist works on a sculpture or painting for 3 months, he might still enter flow on most of the days, but the result doesn't happen until he is finished. You don't get a medal every time you spar in your boxing gym, neither do you get a degree every time you read an interesting paper. Of course the personal joy and fulfillment, or the things we learn might count as a result, but I'm talking about an actual tangible goal here (the discussion about what could count as a result would derail this a lot, so just bear with me). And of course once again same could be said about video games. I don't need to see my minecraft house be finished in one day, BUT, the tens, sometimes hundrets, maybe thousands of small ""results"" sprinkled inbetween the gameplay are the exact hits to the reward system our brain loves so much. Forging a sword in real life? How about 5 years of training and tens of hours of work. Forging a sword in Skyrim? Click, done, there it is, shiny and new. Training a pet to do an awesome trick in real life? Months, maybe years to go. Teaching a pokemon a new attack? Just 13 more minutes of grinding and I can use Ember. Those little rewards can keep you to the screen even if the game does not give you the actual flow of difficult enough but not too hard. And time goes by in that way fast. 

Now, for the work question. I personally think, that the idea of finding work which gives you lets you enter a flow state, is a very high demand and goal to put on yourself. Maybe 1-5% of people in the workforce have that luxury. And if you really have something you want to pursue that you love and make a living off of it, awesome. But most people are not as fortunate. 

Hunting wasn't always fun for our ancestors. I don't imagine them being out there experiencing flow for 4 days straight, itching to go back whenever they brought their prey home immediately. It was rough, but what made them do it was the reward of feeding themselves and caring for their loved ones. That's exactly why drugs (aswell as porn and games) are such easy to get addicted to habits. You take the ballance of exhausting yourself because it's worth it and skew it way towards the ""worth it"" with a lot less ""exhausting"" (in the short term that is). Working out and eating healthy for a healthy body in your fifties is hard, good in the long term, but hard. Eating pizza and playing games for 15 hours straight is not hard compared to how fun it is, and you don't have to wait for the result in the future. The fun and tasty happens now. Taking cocaine? How about an experience of reward 100 times that of any activity you enjoy for the difficulty of sniffing powder up your nose. 

That's why I always tell my clients that the ""why"" of their pursuit is so important. I'll stay with the drugs for a tad more. Suppose you want to drop alkohol. Tough process (even live-threatening if you do it yourself), the cravings will be really massive the first months and they won't leave for the rest of your life, sure they'll become more seldom, weaker, shorter, but they will always be there. And one drink might mean months of consumtion again. So of course the brain at some point will ask itself ""why the f*ck am I doing this?"". That's the point where you need an answer, if you don't have it, the reptilian part of the brain, looking for immediate problem solution will kick in and look for the next bottle. 

To come full circle: If you have the possibility to pursue your dream job, great. If not, then you might try to not impose a standard of ""I should enter flow at my work somehow"" on yourself. Make your job easier, sure, more manageable, find fun things to do, maybe form solid realtionships with co-workers. But ask yourself what your ""why"" is outside of it. Maybe to support your family, maybe to support your hobby, maybe to keep a roof over your head and food in your stomach because you have other goals a year from now. Whatever it is, find that and try to lessen the stress your job gives you. Remeber, the hunt doesn't have to be fun or put you into flow, but you need that prey.

That was long, sorry. But Corona gave me some time to spent and I tend to be a bit wordy when explaining something. 
Anyways, have a good day and stay safe.",g5ig60,fo4as4n,2020-04-21 20:32:06

Please request physical therapy. They don’t do that by default but it makes a difference. You don’t notice it right away but the motion of your arms become limited over time and affects pain. Also scar tissue is better when it is worked on to break it down. 

I had a different breast surgery and now when I lift my arms above my head I get dizzy cause they are so tight. I thought it was just me then my friend who had breast reduction said the same thing. Her arms aren’t flexible. I noticed later on other women go through the same thing. You are young so your body will snap back faster but even a short period of physical therapy makes a huge difference. I would also like to point out exercise and physical therapy are two different things. Your back could benefit from the PT as well.

Your upper and mid back and the muscles that connect to your shoulder blade are going to have to re-learn how to keep you upright. Rowing exercise is crucial for women with large breasts and can decrease low back pain when done correctly. A good PT can get you a home exercise program that will be maintenance for years to come. Keeping the skin/front of body musculature from tightening down post-op is vital.

My wife had a similar situation and they refused to take enough off during her first surgery, which has created a return of pain with pregnancy. 800g is a lot, good for you.

AITA for telling my husband that he needs to get himself under control?,"YTA - My mother’s death was incredibly difficult for many reasons which were out of my control.

I had to take a leave of absence from my job, counseling and psychological therapy, etc. before I was finally able to heal enough to function in society again. 

The fact that your husband is still struggling means he needs help, not you judging him and telling him to get his stuff together. His eating is a symptom not a new hobby. His reaction, to pull farther away from you and become more isolated at your words, is worrisome.

Essentially you have berated him for an issue he is going to be blatantly aware of already. He is feeling totally lost right now and by you saying what you did in that way has just made it feel to him that ‘nobody understands’ and emphasises what he has lost.

"The “relationship with food” narrative is a scam, and we have been gaslit for years","I am so tired of hearing about “healing your relationship with food.” Food is not a person. There is no relationship to fix. Yet for years, people with obesity have been told by thin dietitians and mental health professionals that we are just thinking about food the wrong way. That if we fix our mindset, everything will fall into place. That we will suddenly feel normal hunger and fullness, be able to eat whatever and whenever we want, and lose weight effortlessly.

I believed it. I ate to full hunger and satiety, I went through “extreme hunger”. I tried therapy. I practiced intuitive eating. I journaled about my feelings toward food. I convinced myself that if I could just heal my relationship with food, my body would finally cooperate. Finally my body would “click”. But no matter how much I worked on it, nothing changed. I was still hungry all the time. I still struggled with my appetite. Still waking up during the night hungry. I still held onto weight.

Then after 2 years of contemplating I start a medication that directly addressed the biological drivers of hunger and appetite, and suddenly the struggle are mostly gone. No mental gymnastics. No overanalyzing my cravings. No pretending my hunger was normal when it actually never was.

At this point, I have to ask. How many of us were gaslit into believing we could think our way out of obesity? How many of us wasted years blaming ourselves while an entire industry profited from selling us an illusion?

I want to hear from others. Have you ever felt like you were being manipulated into believing your weight was just a mindset and “eating enough whenever you are hungry” issue? What finally made you realize the truth?",1ijttfp,n/a,2025-02-07 12:25:19

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"Hello everyone! My name is Andrew, I'm a 20's-something game developer from the United States and I am currently in Berlin for work. I head back home on Wednesday, but since I've been here I've noticed something about the culture around food here that is so marginally different from that in the US that I felt like sharing.

#The United States has a strange relationship with food

I will never not appreciate how convenient food is in the US. From roadside restaurants and fast food to 24/hr grocery stores and popular fast-at-home food options; the United States food culture is all about filling you up fast and getting you on your way at any time during the day. I have learned it is both the greatest and WORST thing in the world.

***Let me explain:***

I was once told that Americans have a weird relationship with food; we don't treat it the way we should. We eat food NOT as an activity, but as an idle behavior.

•Watching TV - Eat

•Playing games - Eat

•Driving - Eat

•Working - Eat

•Doing literally nothing - Eat

We eat and snack at nearly every time in the day. It's not *SECTIONED OFF* at all. Eating food isn't respected enough to have its own place in our daily schedule; it is thrown into the mix with 500 other things. Food is only there so that we can either continue to live or to busy ourselves with something to do.

But here in Berlin it is totally different. Restuarants don't even OPEN until like Noon at the EARLIEST. The restaurants near me open at frickin' 4:00 PM for crying out loud. Resturants that aren't even strictly dinner type restaurants still open at a later time in the day. There are no fast food places nearby. I've yet to see a SINGLE ONE this entire time. I know there is a McDonalds a few kilometers away from me, but in a dense city, a few kilometers might as well be 15 miles.

All restaurants here either have you go in and sit down or take it with you. ALSO restaurants don't have parking either. You either walk/bike there or use public transportation (which also involves walking). It's an active process to go out and get food, not an idle one.

The grocery stores are the same exact way. I've been to three just to look around. Two of them are out on the streets with no parking (just like restaurants) and the final one was on the top story of a 3 story tall mall. There wasn't even a snack isle, there was a snack corner with hardly anything. The frozen foods section COMBINED was smaller than one frozen isle at Walmart. However, their freshly baked bread, produce, and home cooking ingredients areas literally made up the rest of the grocery store. In the US that would be unheard of.

#It's so strange when you take this and compare it to how we acquire food in America

We have fast food EVERYWHERE, and driving is so normal in the US that a short drive to McDonald's is always worth it. On top of that, most places are so far apart here you HAVE to drive. Everyone has a car, so public transportation is nonexistent.

Furthermore, sit-down restaurants are not only less common, but WIDELY more expensive. Here in Berlin all restuarant have pretty competitive prices. I got a large pizza yesterday for like $8.50 and it was baked in a stone oven and the ingredients were either fresh or hand crafted right there. In the US that is unheard of, but $5 quickly made pizzas are on every block.

Grocery stores are different too. The layouts and options at stores in the US, even at stores considered ""healthy"" or ""natural"", are laughable compared to the stores I have seen here. Freshly baked breads, freshly cut meats, fresh produce, and home cooking ingredients usually reside in the same corner of the store. EVERYWHERE ELSE is frozen foods, snacks, or other unhealthy options. Endcaps and other displays in the walking lanes of grocery stores are commonly unhealthy and fast-food-type meals you likely would use a microwave for.

#Closing off

We have such an awkward relationship with food in the US it is no wonder everyone struggles with weight. It's not just WHAT you are eating, but the entire process of it.

•WHAT you are eating

•HOW you are eating

•WHEN you are eating

•ACQUIRING food for eating.

It's all so different that it's insane to even compare them. I'm excited to return to my fridge of frozen meals and my fast food restaurants, but now that I truly see how other people treat food, I want to jump on that and try some of that behavior for myself.

Thanks for reading!

#TL;DR

The US treats food as an idle behavior rather than an activity. It blends together with other things we do during the day, and even WHEN we eat, our selections of food are almost always of unhealthy variety.",drvyh0,n/a,2019-11-05 07:37:06
American advertising normalizes an abnormally unhealthy relationship with food.,"I was washing dishes the other night and saw this ad come on tv, basically suggesting that even though you’ve already brushed your teeth for the night, you should just disregard that and have a late night Reese’s and brush again later. [Weird Reese’s Ad](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D0wjgr1_1f8)

It got me to thinking about how that’s not normal healthy behavior. I don’t think normal healthy people get ready for bed, then decide, “nah, let’s eat some candy right before going to sleep, even though I’ve already brushed my teeth.” I understand that the commercial may be in jest, but it suggests that idea, anyway. And I wonder, how many other messages are whispered in our ears that makes us think these bad decisions are okay, or even normal?

It reminds me of a Little Debbie ad I heard on the radio, where the speaker basically said you deserve to treat yourself, then came up with the flimsiest excuses to reward yourself with a Little Debbie (you got up out of bed I think was one example). 

Even if it’s using humor to sell a product, I still think it’s helpful to reconsider advertising from an objective perspective to think about how it may affect your behavior. I used to binge on sweets in the worst way, and even now I have to keep them completely out of the house to avoid the temptation, because I understand that I cannot have a normal relationship with that type of food. Have there been any outside influences that have made you think certain unhealthy eating habits were “normal?”",iuapxm,n/a,2020-09-17 02:43:30
AITA for eating ice cream every night just like I always do and not stopping just bc my SIL doesn't want my niece to see it?,"Most nights after dinner, I eat a small ice cream cone. It’s literally the little “joy mini cups” with a teeny scoop of ice cream. Maybe a big scoop if I’m having a rough day but that’s kinda rare. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke weed or do anything “fun” so this is my one fun thing I do for myself. 

My brother and his wife and daughter are staying with me for a few weeks, they’ll be gone by June 15. I’m happy to have them here. Usually we’ll eat dinner together and go our separate ways for the evening. They watch a lot of TV so they’re usually all in the living room watching. 

I’ve been eating my lil cone, but my sister in law approached me and asked me if I could stop. She said that my niece is starting to ask why she doesn’t get to have ice cream and that obviously she was lied to by my sister in law when she told her ice cream is a sometimes food, haha. 

I said that I wasn’t going to stop but I could wait until she was in bed. I figured that was a good compromise and I do get that she’s trying to raise her little girl to have a healthy relationship with food. But waiting until she was in bed didn’t work because she came into the kitchen multiple times to ask me for some. 

My SIL was definitely a little incredulous over it and kept saying “Really? Do you seriously NEED to eat ice cream every single day?” or stuff like it. I said no, but she also doesn’t need to drink a glass of wine every day either. She didn’t like this and sighed a bunch and has been visibly annoyed with me since then. My brother asked me if I could stop just to avoid the drama, but I said I deserve my little treats. AITA?

  
**Hi so I've decided to log off this post and not come back.** This post has just gotten completely out of control with really over the top overreactions and people trying to encourage me to make things worse or escalate and call my sil an alcoholic or to purposely eat more ice cream in front of my niece. Some of you are just like chomping at the bit to call people names and be sarcastic and nasty to me for no reason. That's not really what I was expecting and we're not allowed to delete posts so I'm just going to log out and move on. ",1kxi2yw,n/a,2025-05-28 14:10:24
Does anyone else feel like calorie counting messed up their relationship with food?,"Hello everyone, I wanted to start a conversation, even though it might not be popular. Yes, I have lost weight after months of calorie counting, but lately I feel like I'm obsessed with every bite. I can't even have a casual dinner with friends without mentally recording everything. I'm thankful for the advancement and know it works. However, is it truly long-term sustainable? I feel like I'm exchanging mental weight for physical weight sometimes. Has anyone else experienced this? Have you discovered a more healthful method to maintain your diet without developing a food obsession? Sincerely interested in how you all handle this ❤️",1m3t1qz,n/a,2025-07-19 10:35:03
"The “relationship with food” narrative is a scam, and we have been gaslit for years","I am so tired of hearing about “healing your relationship with food.” Food is not a person. There is no relationship to fix. Yet for years, people with obesity have been told by thin dietitians and mental health professionals that we are just thinking about food the wrong way. That if we fix our mindset, everything will fall into place. That we will suddenly feel normal hunger and fullness, be able to eat whatever and whenever we want, and lose weight effortlessly.

I believed it. I ate to full hunger and satiety, I went through “extreme hunger”. I tried therapy. I practiced intuitive eating. I journaled about my feelings toward food. I convinced myself that if I could just heal my relationship with food, my body would finally cooperate. Finally my body would “click”. But no matter how much I worked on it, nothing changed. I was still hungry all the time. I still struggled with my appetite. Still waking up during the night hungry. I still held onto weight.

Then after 2 years of contemplating I start a medication that directly addressed the biological drivers of hunger and appetite, and suddenly the struggle are mostly gone. No mental gymnastics. No overanalyzing my cravings. No pretending my hunger was normal when it actually never was.

At this point, I have to ask. How many of us were gaslit into believing we could think our way out of obesity? How many of us wasted years blaming ourselves while an entire industry profited from selling us an illusion?

I want to hear from others. Have you ever felt like you were being manipulated into believing your weight was just a mindset and “eating enough whenever you are hungry” issue? What finally made you realize the truth?",1ijtqmq,n/a,2025-02-07 12:20:39
AITA for blowing up at my parents for something my adult sister did?,"I (26F) have a sister, “Amy” (28F), who has always had a difficult relationship with food. She was bullied as a kid and turned to food for comfort. As an adult, she still struggles with self-control, especially around things she finds appetizing. Our parents have never set boundaries with her around food, and that’s carried into adulthood—she currently lives with them, and they do all the grocery shopping and cooking.

My husband (28M) recently had a birthday, and I planned a surprise party. I sent him out of the house for a few hours so I could set up and asked my parents to come help. I specifically asked them not to bring Amy setting up involved putting out snacks, drinks, and a homemade cake with frosting.

They showed up with Amy anyway, saying it wouldn’t be fair to exclude her. I gave her a few small tasks and specifically asked her not to touch any of the food until guests arrived, but I was too busy to keep a constant eye on her.

At one point, I went into the kitchen and found Amy with the fridge open, eating the frosting out of the mixing bowl. She had eaten nearly half of it. As soon as she saw me, she burst into tears and said she only meant to try a little but couldn’t stop.

My parents heard us and came in. My mom said it wasn’t that big of a deal since the cake was untouched and I still had enough frosting for a crumb coat, but I had planned to do specific cake decorations, and now there wasn’t enough frosting; I didn’t have the time or ingredients to make more. My dad suggested going to the store to buy a tub of pre-made frosting, saying it was the same thing. I explained my husband tries to avoid a lot of the ingredients found in store-bought frosting and wouldn’t want that. My dad said to just not tell him since he “wouldn’t even know the difference“. 

That suggestion was super frustrating to me. I told my parents that they couldn't convince me that this was no big deal, and that they had allowed this by not setting boundaries with Amy’s binge eating and by bringing her to set up. They told me to back off and be more sensitive to my sister, and that it wasn’t her fault. I responded by saying that I was more angry at them, because at least Amy felt bad while they were trying to downplay the situation. 

They got upset and said it wasn’t fair to blame them for Amy’s choices, and that she was an adult and they can’t control her. They also said that they were trying to help by giving suggestions, and that I was being stubborn by shutting all of them down. They ended up leaving, and now they’re giving me the silent treatment, even though Amy has apologized for eating the frosting. AITA for involving them in this?",1l2j2zu,n/a,2025-06-03 18:11:03
AITA for “forcing” my wife to eat,"My wife (28F) and I (29M) have been married for a year, together for six. Over that time, I’ve gotten really concerned about her eating habits, and it's starting to cause some serious friction. 

She literally just doesn't seem to enjoy food at all. She'll say stuff like, ""I wish we didn't have to eat to survive and we could just choose if we wanted to go out to a fun restaurant. It would be for like a hobby."" She also just straight up tells me she doesn't like food and she’s never hungry. 

The biggest issue is that she'll only eat dinner because I'm home to make sure she does. During the day, she'll just forget to eat or avoid it entirely. Even at dinner, she's super particular about what she'll eat. And if I’m not home for dinner, she again will not eat. I’ve seen her hiding food in the trashcan that she said that she ate. It’ll be an excuse like she had a few bites and got full, but I don’t think she even took bites. Don’t even get me started with her not eating breakfast.

When I try to talk to her about it, she gets defensive. I’ve brought up the possibility of an eating disorder, but she shuts it down immediately, saying she's fine because she weighs 140 pounds and is 5’5”.  (The weight she says she is.)

It's gotten to the point where I feel like I have to force her to eat, and it just turns into a fight. She gets mad at me, and I feel like an asshole for causing these arguments. But I'm just so worried about her health. I don't know what to do.

And maybe I wouldn’t be so worried if she wasn’t on the treadmill for like three hours a day without fueling her body. It’s not three hours constantly. It’s just going to the basement several times to get on the treadmill.

Should I keep “forcing” her to eat, even though it's causing us to fight? Or should I just let her do what she wants. She would go for days without eating if I didn’t say anything.

Edit to answer the question if anything has happened or changed. She was sexually assaulted by our drunken exfriend at a party that was about six or seven months ago. He kept grabbing her butt and she said she mentally blacked out which is why she only walked away and didn’t say anything to him. It happened three times total in that night. I sent him a nasty text and he admitted to knowing what he did. I reached out to other friends, letting them know what happened and that we would no longer be around if he OR his wife were invited. (Who was one of her close friends and never reached out) Which is a horrible situation, i’ve tried asking if she wants to go to therapy she says she’s fine, so I don’t know if that’s contributing to this.

Ever since dating she’s had a weird relationship with food, but it’s definitely gotten worse over the last year I would say. She is also not on any medication and refers to her mom as an almond mom. 

Update: I made her get on the scale in front of me I know it’s harsh but has opened my eyes. She’s at 116.",1mewjek,n/a,2025-08-01 13:29:58
Anyone else have messed up relationships with food now?,"I remembered recently a time when I was very young, around 6ish, and both of my parents worked, but my dad worked from home so he would be in charge of us (me bro and sis) for the day while she was out. On the days mum was out, we wouldn't get any food until she came back because dad was too busy to sort any food out for us. I remember being hungry a lot as a kid. As an adult I eat at weird times, go long periods without eating and then eat way too much at once. Not sure I can blame my dad entirely but I reckon there's something there.",qvxu0b,n/a,2021-11-17 12:04:26
Anyone else feel like calorie tracking is low-key ruining their relationship with food?,"I’ve been using different apps for the past year, and while I’ve definitely learned a lot, I sometimes catch myself obsessing over numbers more than how I actually *feel* after eating. Like, I know awareness is key, but is there a point where tracking becomes… counterproductive?

Curious if anyone else has found a better balance or maybe even ditched calorie counting altogether and still made progress? ",1jjis4u,n/a,2025-03-25 13:00:23
AITAH for calling the ambulance for my co-worker even though I know she was kind of faking it?,"**I am NOT the Original Poster. That is** [Normal\_Midnight1661](https://www.reddit.com/user/Normal_Midnight1661/). He posted in r/AITAH

# Do NOT comment on Original Posts. Latest update is 7 days old.

**Trigger Warning:** >!unspecified eating disorder; !<

**Mood Spoiler:** >!honestly kind of sad, though hopefully things will be better for everyone now!<

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kmzdep/aitah_for_calling_the_ambulance_for_my_coworker/)**: May 14, 2025**

I (28M) am working in an English language center in a Southeast Asian country. There's a female co-worker in her 20s here who often touches her head and wobbles like she was about to faint, and she would lie down on the couch, letting people fan her, bring water and food to her. We take midday naps here, so whenever she does this, everyone's lunch and nap time is ruined, especially the ones who keep caring for her.

This would happen at least twice a month, so over the last 5 or 6 months, I've seen a few incidents when we worked the same shift. One time she even asked me to order ice cream for her. (info, it's a big, crowded city, so you can just walk to the ice cream shop nearby to grab one for a dollar). Didn't pay me back, but that's beside the point.

This Monday, she did it again, and this time she asked a girl to order her an iced drink, a sandwich. A group of co-workers fanned her, did the whole caring thing like she's a sick child.

I stood up from my chair, walked towards her, asked if she was OK, then I went to the men's washroom, dialed for an ambulance and went back to my seat. After 20 minutes, we heard the siren, my phone rang again, and I stood up and told her ""servants"" to help her to the ambulance.

Her face CHANGED, you know, that face, when someone knows they fked up, other girls asked if I called, I said yeah, it seems more severe this time. It's best for her to go. The ambulance is here already, you'll have to pay for it regardless (the ambulance fee is about 1-2 days worth of her salary, \~50 dollars). Other coworkers actually agreed and helped her get on the ambulance. Now that I think of it, no one called an ambulance for her once.

Ever since that incident, she stopped interacting with me beyond hi's and hello's (Thursday now, not a word to me). AITAH for this?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: NTA. Thanks for a funny story!

>**OOP:** Half of me thinks it's funny but half of me feels guilty because she propably paid 2 days worth of her salary on the ambulance.

Commenter: She probably hadn't been paying anyone else back for things like drinks and food. So I figure the fee for the ambulance was her AH tax. :)

>**OOP:** Oooh I should dm other coworkers to see if she's paid them back. It's just a dollar or two though.

Commenter: I'm gonna disagree with everyone here, YTA, ambulances are meant to save lives and not deal with petty squabbles. That said, from the title alone I would have agreed with you, as you don't know if someone is faking or not, but you have deliberately hid the fact that you're calling for it, didn't ask her if it's needed etc. Also I would like to point out that, while she does seem to be faking it and in general acts like an asshole, her reaction to the ambulance could be due to the cost, so it is no proof of faking it

>**OOP:** Which is why I posted. I secretly called so she couldn't disagree to it. Maybe she's actually not faking it and it is of a sensitive topic (severe menstruation as some people suggested). But you can't deny that she's been abusing it a little bit. Turned out some co-workers havent get their money back yet from buying her stuff as she demanded too. *\[editor's note- these comments are chronological, so OOP dmed the coworkers between answering the last comment and this one\]*

Commenter: Damn this is something I actually want an update on.

After that incident did she stop her faking for a bit? Did she continue? I feel like if she stopped for a bit, you should tell your coworkers the ambulance trick worked n they need to do it. Every time you see her you should be annoying n just ask if she is feeling okay! lol

>**OOP:** It's only been 4 days. Usually she acts up every 2 weeks, sometimes once a week but in a milder way. Tired, headaches, etc. Not fully laying on the couch.  
It'sa small update but I texted 2 girls a turned out she hasnt paid them back food money, but they're teachers so they said it didn't bother them. My workplace is very nice and peaceful otherwise.

Commenter: Curious how you know she is faking it?

>**OOP:** Just a hunch really. People in pain and people faking pain look different. It's the subtle details that I cannot really explain. It looks forced/exaggerated (?)  
I might be talking out of my ass here but I imagine if someone is in pain and groaning, they would sweat, heat up, or go pale (?), again. IDK, but it feels weird when you see it.

Commenter: Sorry, but that’s just not evidence. Everyone reacts to things and shows things differently. Just because you wouldn’t react like that doesn’t mean she wouldn’t. An example is seizures. They often look very different to how people would expect. On TV they’re always exaggerated jerking and shaking. Sometimes they can look like that, but sometimes people go stiff and completely still, sometimes it’s tiny like a small muscle contraction, sometimes it looks like zoning out. So if you saw someone zoning out instead of jerking around would you say they were faking it?

Or people react differently to stress. Some people cry. But other people laugh. Would you not believe them because they’re not reacting how you would?

You have no idea of this woman’s history. Maybe she is faking it? Why do you need to be the one to stop it? The people looking after her have minds of their own and you just don’t have enough evidence if it’s based on a hunch. The ambulance you called was malicious and just to prove a point and teach her a lesson. But you don’t know for 100% if she has a medical condition or not. Maybe she does and it is managed by the things you say people help her with. You cannot do that to someone on a “hunch”.

>**OOP:** I agree with your view. Maybe a few more days I'll try to ask about her hospital visit in a polite way.

Commenter: ETA. I say this as a personal with chronic illness. Faking obviously sucks. However, I wouldn't want anyone to call an ambulance without my premision if I struggled with my chronic illnesses. Eventhogh, the ambulance is free here. Would still annoy me. I am not dying. I faint quite often and have some other issues. I usually sit down, drink some water, and maybe get someone to watch if it gets bad.

Emergency services are meant for emergencies, not for being petty. You just waisted their time.

>**OOP:** I agree. Was petty of me to bother the hospital. But other than that I don't know what else to do. Confronting her, texting her, talking to other co-workers behind her, staying silent all seem wrong.

Commenter: I used to get fainting spells for that reason, and eating a bit and drinking some water would usually help me feel *better* (but not cured, obviously), so that's what I would go for when it happened. Took about 6 years to get diagnosed.

Everyone making a big fuss probably isn't helping the coworker feel better, and OP should probably have gone for ""You should go home"" before calling an ambulance (honestly I found it difficult to believe that an ambulance would come unless OP lied to them - they certainly wouldn't have in England).

>**OOP:** Here, caller provides name, phone number, ID, answer some questions, and ambulance will come. The phone number must match the one registered on your ID.  
The patient will be charged digitally through their ID scan or by cash, bank transfer or by a tag-along person. I know this because I went with a relative by ambulance when he got stomachache.

Commenter: Sorry, I'm just stuck on the fee. Is it $50? And is $50 1-2 days of her pay?

>**OOP:** Yeah, southeast asian country. Ambulance is cheap, but salary is also low compared to the US. Actually, most of my foreign relatives book flights to Vietnam for medical care. Diabetes and such. Insulin is cheap here.  
*To another commenter:*  
Vietnam. Far location is 50, near hospital is 25 actually.

**Mini Update in Comments: May 15, 2025 (Next Day)**

Oooh I've been asking around. Apparently Miss Faint haven't paid some of the co-workers back their food money, borrowed money from a few people, and asked to ""have a bite"" of some people's food. I'm added to a private group chat with 5 other coworkers. I will give update later, today was a lot for me at work.

*Another comment:*

We made a group chat and provided a lot of proof last night. This is an HR problem now and we will notify HR instead of talking directly to her. She has been texting other coworkers and borrowing money to go to the hospital. She exclusively targets female teachers and requires them to not share the matter with others. This is beyond me now, will update after HR solve it.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kq6je3/update_aitah_for_calling_the_ambulance_for_my/)**: May 19, 2025 (4 days later, 5 from OG post)**

Here's the update on the female co-worker who kept ""fainting"" and asking people to order food for her. I'll call her Anne, because there's a lot of women involved in this update.

\- After the first post, I texted some female coworkers to see if they had received food money back. Two female teachers told me that they hadn't, but they didn't mind. The total amount was around 20 dollars per person.

\- Words got around fast, and I was added to a group of 5 OTHER people, so in total, at least 7 female teachers were affected by Anne.

\- Based on their word, Anne has low blood pressure and malnutrition, she indeed is very thin (Kpop idol type of body). She clearly has some unhealthy relationship with food. It's almost as if she doesn't want to pay for food.

\- She borrowed money from multiple female teachers to ""pay hospital bills"", and begged them to not disclose this information to others. We're talking up to a loan that worths FOUR MONTHS of salary. She basically borrowed half of that teacher's emergency funds.

\- She also flirted with one female teacher, said teacher often brings her on small dinner dates. I didn't ask on this matter.

\- HR was notified, the girls did the talking, I was called in as ""the one who called the ambulance"".

\- After the meeting, it's confirmed that Anne will be let go after 30 days, the reasoning was ""creating a hostile workplace environment"". This morning was really awkward.

\- Unfortunately, HR cannot help with the loans that people have given her, as it's personal matter. However, HR is willing to provide personal information of Anne to the affected coworkers. ?????? Oh well. It's their matter now.

Now, answering some comments from the previous post:

\- Some mentioned that I was wasting healthcare resources. Well, she was examined and came back with a diagnosis.

\- Some asked me why everything's so cheap. It's Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. Most things are affordable here except real estate lol. In fact, my overseas relatives literally book flights to Vietnam for medical care. Insulin here is like 3-7 dollars per vial and you can buy it at almost any public or private hospital. If you have national healthcare ID, it's basically free.

\- Some was worried for me because I accidentally slipped my personal social media page on the previous post. I don't really care honestly, I'm considered a valuable asset, and I'm easy to work with. If anything comes up, I think the company and I will be able to solve it peacefully. *\[editor's note- OOP had linked some tiktoks to people asking about the nap situation\]*

\- Yes, people take midday naps in Vietnam, you're the odd one if you don't. If I'm not standing a class, I'm allowed to be online, doing Tiktoks, etc. Having a Tiktok account is not a legal reason to be let go.

\- There's one Redditor here who was incredibly vindictive and was trying to antagonise me in the dms. Girl get a grip, you deliberately ignored all other comments. You're blocked. Byeeeeee.

And finally, don't lend your coworkers half of your emergency funds. ????? Like whyyyy.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Damn that’s just *low* to prey on other women like that. Still NTA. You put an end to her abusing your coworkers’ kindness.

>**OOP:** TEACHERS no less. I literally work with the kindest angels.

Commenter: Thanks for the update - man what a wild ride! I like that your feedback of a prank on a pattern of bad behavior turned into this huge unmasking of the extent her harmful behavior!

NTA

Why diagnosis did they give her?

>**OOP:** Low blood pressure and malnutrition

Commenter: Is it possible she is supporting her parents or family and doesn’t have enough money for food for herself?

>**OOP:** Nah, she doesn't come across as someone who's in need. Her position offers good salary. I think she has a problematic relationship with food more than anything. Maybe a form of eating disorder.

Commenter: (downvoted) Calling an ambulance for a madeup emergency, is illegal for a reason. You wasted resources on an ambulance that could've been used for someone who actually needed it. Next time you want to make a point, do it in a way that doesn't potentially put someone's life in danger. 

>**OOP:** I don't know your location to judge the scarcity of ambulances, but in Vietnam, hospitals are a dime a dozen. One dispatched ambulance won't be a problem here. Plus, she made up the emergency, not me. I responded to the scene. Additionally, she was in fact clinically diagnosed and provided papers to HR. If it were you, what would you do. Remember this has been going for 6 months.",1kvxxp2,n/a,2025-05-26 15:58:15
The most interesting thing about Adult Misty as a character is her relationship with food.,"The woman just eats. All the time. Snacks. Candy. Cakes. Caramel cake. Meat. Strawberries.  Vegetables.

Misty takes revenge on the old lady for throwing perfectly good food on the floor.

She reminds me of Holocaust survivors who said they ate everything off the plate after it happened.

She cannot understand why Tai and Natalie would hate meat.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"**I am NOT the Original Poster. That is** [ThrowRAgoldenbride](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRAgoldenbride/). She posted in r/AmItheAsshole

# Do NOT comment on Original Posts. Latest update is 7 days old. Long Post.

**Editor's note:** This was a complicated one to aggregate because OOP left so many comment. Many of them were super informative and helpful in understanding her perspective. They also answered a lot of questions people had. I tried to include only a few, but this did end up being a longer post.

**Trigger Warning:** >!OOP has narcissistic personality disorder; ableism; controlling behavior!<

**Mood Spoiler:** >!things are looking better!<

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pdwg0/aita_for_wanting_people_to_wear_white_at_my/)**: July 3, 2023**

So I'm (24F) having a hard time seeing where I went wrong, but me and my husband to be (26M) both struggle with NPD \[narcissistic personality disorder\] so I figured an outside opinion might be helpful, since neither of us tends to understand when we're wrong right away.

I'm getting married (yay!) in December to the absolute love of my life, and we both want it to be the most spectacular wedding the world has ever seen because we both really love attention. I never used to feel comfortable admitting that, but ever since I've been with him I've been able to really accept that, and it's made my life so much more \*fun.\* We decided that instead of having me in a white dress like all the other white dresses, and him in the same tuxedo as every man in attendance, it would look really spectacular if we both dressed head to toe in gold. What we want is for all our guests to wear either black, white, or grey, and for us to be the only ones wearing color. I figured that not only would I look like a princess, but I'd also be dancing with a prince instead of just some guy, and he's so into the idea that he remembers it as being his. We just love that idea of a sea of monochrome, and then us in the middle of it all.

The only thing is, my sister (26F) has been absolutely furious at us ever since the clothing requirements came out. First, she said this was ""proof that I never changed"" and I was being controlling again. Basically, that asking guests to wear a specific color was insane. Then she started making digs about my hair and how I was ""just doing this to show off"" and asked if I planned to have her dye her hair too (I did not, we're both blonde but mine is a bit more yellow-blonde, and my husband is dying his hair for the wedding). I admitted to that, but also pointed out that it's my wedding and it's normal. Then she accused me of trying to upstage everyone else's wedding dress, basically implying that I was trying to get everyone to show up in wedding dresses so I could compete with them and make myself look even better by comparison.

This was not ever the plan. When I mentioned what she said to my husband to be, his eyes kind of lit up in this really cute way and he said we should encourage people to actually wear their own wedding clothes, but we decided it would probably be actually terrible of us. We decided to let our families wear copper if they wanted, so they would stand out as a nice accent to gold, and then my sister would also get to stand out. I was totally willing to pay, and said as much. That was when she called me a spoiled child, and said she wasn't like me and wasn't in this for herself, and wanted all the guests to be able to wear ""normal wedding clothes"" and that nobody in their right mind would be comfortable wearing white to a wedding.

TL;DR: I want all my guests to wear black, white, or grey to my wedding, and my husband and I to wear gold. My sister thinks this is horrible and I'm making everyone feel uncomfortable. AITA?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: It sounds like a really pretty wedding. I don't think upstaging everyone who has ever had a wedding is the goal here, but I also think every person who has a wedding wants it to be special and memorable in their own way. Kinda weird your sister doesn't feel that way.

>**OOP:** She's really against events where I get attention. I get it, considering how I was before I knew I had NPD and how to handle it, but I guess I thought a wedding was an appropriate time to want attention, you know?

Commenter: Have you tried to make things right with her since your diagnosis? It can be a bit traumatizing to have any kind of relationship, familial or otherwise, with someone who has NPD.

>**OOP:** I have. We went to therapy together when I was 18, and since then, our relationship has been 100% on her terms. I really do want to make things right, and have been trying to for a long time.

Commenter: \[...\] I wonder if your sister is just kicking back because you're not having a traditional wedding and she's jealous of the attention you'll receive?

>**OOP:** She had a really traditional wedding last year, and I wasn't actually invited to that, so I don't know a lot of details, but I know she wasn't happy with how it went. I do think that my dress code is pretty simple, especially since, not to be macabre, but everyone has funeral clothes, right?

Commenter: NTA it's your wedding and this is your special day. If anyone has a problem with that they shouldn't come.

>**OOP:** I do want her there, though. Like, if I'm being unreasonable here, I'd rather know than not.

Commenter: Can i ask why you had been excluded from her wedding?

>**OOP:** Ever since I was 16, she hasn't wanted me at any events focused on her. She asked me to stay home for her highschool graduation, all her birthdays, her college graduation, and I couldn't meet her child until a week after either. We sometimes celebrate alone, but when we were growing up, I would do something to grab attention pretty often, at basically any event I was invited to. I've done a lot of growing up since then and apologized a bunch of times, but she still doesn't trust me.

Commenter: May i ask what you mean by stealing the spotlight? Was it on purpose or was it that you naturally draw attention

>**OOP:** It wasn't like it was malicious but it wasn't exactly not on purpose either. I just absolutely love when everyone is watching me, and I'm pretty good at a lot of things. On my sister's 17th birthday I ""gifted"" her a song I wrote (I got the idea from a tv show) and everyone spent the rest of the party saying how good I was, and that was one of the big things she brought up when she first banned me from her events. I honestly just loved the attention and it didn't occur to me that what I was doing took something away from her, because I figured everyone loved watching me so I was just making her parties better, and I thought she also loved watching me. I get it now, and I get that what I did was really wrong, but I didn't understand at the time.

Commenter: How in the world could you see nothing wrong with taking all the attention?

>**OOP:** I honestly didn't think I was doing anything bad. A lot of people liked watching me do things from when I was very young, and my dad always said that when I performed it made people happy. I always figured that, when I performed, I was making a party or event better for everyone, and I thought my sister also liked to watch me, and I loved it a lot. Everything seemed to reinforce that this was a good thing, and I never thought about it as taking something away from my sister.

Commenter: Sounds like you have a good amount of insight into your self-centredness and are trying to work on it. \[...\]

>**OOP:** Thank you. I'm doing my best to grow and be better than I used to be. I know I'll never not be a narcissist, but I'm trying to be more careful not to hurt the people around me or take attention away from other people's accomplishments.

Commenter (downvoted): NTA. Are you sure you have NPD and aren’t just the family scapegoat?

>**OOP:** I definitely have NPD. I just also have years of therapy and hard work under my belt, and a really supportive and wonderful partner who has allowed me to accept some things about myself and work on making them less of a detriment and more of a strength.

*Boundaries/therapy:*

>I'm in therapy! It's been a little tricky to have it be as consistent as I would like, but for now I am in every other week. I know I'll always be a narcissist, no matter what I do, and I want to still be able to have good relationships where I don't hurt or take things away from anyone. I've said something very similar to what you quoted a few times.  
Her boundaries are pretty simple. We only really meet up at either family gatherings, or one-on-one in a private space. If we meet one-on-one, I'm not allowed to talk about myself, my life, or anything I'm accomplishing or working on unless she specifically asks. At family events she'll be at, I need to send her what I'll be wearing ahead of time and have it be non-attention-seeking, and I can't perform (sing, dance, etc) or talk about anything I'm working on unless I ask her permission first, and if she says no I can't ask again. If she tells me she needs to vent, then I can't react or get upset about anything she says to me or tell anyone else about it. That's pretty much everything. It can be tricky at times, but I know that's mostly my disorder, and it's worth it to have her in my life.

Commenter: Sorry to comment on this post three times, but it’s really alarming me. She has to OK your outfits even if it’s an event that is not focused on her? You are not allowed to talk about yourself whatsoever without PERMISSION? I hope someone with more experience with N.PD can tell me if there is a healthy rationale behind this because I think you love your sister so much are not able to clearly see that she is controlling you and is frankly, really mean to you.

>**OOP:** I'm only not allowed to talk about myself at all when it's just us, and then I'm not supposed to ask for permission. When we're at family gatherings, I can talk about myself generally, like my relationships or music I like or anything, I just can't talk about goals or projects I'm working on or accomplishments of any kind without checking, because it's a form of attention seeking. Like, most recently, I had to check if she was okay with me talking about learning how to make pizza from scratch from my husband-to-be, but she said it was fine as long as I talked about the learning process and didn't, like, offer to teach anyone anything or say how great I was at it or anything.  
The outfits thing can be frustrating, especially since she almost always shoots down like three or four outfits before accepting something and it's usually way too hot, but it makes her feel way more comfortable so it's not the biggest deal ever.

*Attention:*

>It's more like... whenever everyone is paying attention to me, I just feel so, so happy, and it's like the best feeling in the world, and sometimes when nobody pays attention I feel... it's just horrible? It's like I feel like I only exist if someone is watching. When I'm alone, I barely even have any feelings. It's just all dull and meaningless. But yeah, it did accumulate in me stealing the spotlight when I shouldn't have. I thought, at the time, that what I was doing was good, because it *felt* right, and a lot of people really do love watching me perform. It didn't occur to me that I was taking something away from my sister. We did go to therapy when I was 18, which is when she put a lot of her boundaries in place.

Commenter: Think about it from your sister’s perspective. If 90% of the time you always had the attention that meant she didn’t and you are totally fine with her feeling horrible because you felt good. So everything, in your mind, is always about you and your desire to feel good. It doesn’t matter to you if no one else exists because only your existence matters?

>**OOP:** I have thought about that a lot in the past 8 years. Before that, I honestly thought that she didn't really like attention, especially not like I did. Main girls in books didn't like attention like I did, same on TV, most of my friends got things like stage fright or nerves talking to strangers that I never did. In my head, this was just how I was, and it seemed less than common.

Commenter: Out of curiosity what is your parents position after all this time, also the clothing thing is ridiculous and you should probably set a boundary on not needing permission

>**OOP:** My dad hates it, and always says it's ridiculous and tries to get me to perform or talk about myself or take off the coats or sweatshirts she makes me wear, and sometimes takes me inside so we can just hang out with people without my mom and sister and I can relax. My mom is very strict though, and says that the boundaries are important and that I abused my sister when we were growing up by stealing attention, so her and her trauma is the most important thing. She made it clear that if I ever refuse, I won't be allowed back at any family event she or my sister are attending. I know my mom and dad fight about it so I try not to bring it up, because I know they love each other and they were going to get divorced for a bit when the rules first started when I was sixteen.

*OOP reiterates:*

>She \[sis\] definitely doesn't dictate my life. I actually only see family maybe once a month, twice sometimes, and the rest of the time I get to be more myself. I still try to be more respectful, and not awful, but I actually love fashion and my hair and performing. My husband to be and I go to karaoke every week at least once, and I'm in a local musical right now!

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1huj9e2/update_aita_for_wanting_people_to_wear_white_at/)**: January 5, 2025 (1.5 years later)**

My husband and I just recently celebrated our first anniversary, and I was thinking about all the dress code drama when I remembered this account and thought it would be fun to give y'all a little one-year update!

After I made my original post, my husband and I decided to contact my sister and parents and have a sit-down discussion about the situation. He offered to take everyone out to eat, and we had this really long discussion about my sister and my relationship.

My sister said she made a promise to herself never to let that happen again, and that if I wanted her in my life, I needed to be a normal person. My husband told her that if she was going to keep humiliating me for something I did as a child, then she wasn't a normal person either. It became a bit chaotic. My dad took our side, and said my sister's taking things too far. My mom took my sister's side, and said that, since I have NPD, I'm not capable of real change and if they ever give in at all they'll be hurting my sister. It ended with my sister calling my father an enabler and threatening to cut him of. It wasn't a great dinner overall.

What surprised me is my sister's husband. She called me the next day at his recommendation, and we talked for a long time. She told me that she doesn't want to feel like ""a side character in the (my name) show,"" and that was how it was for all our childhoods. I told her that I feel like I'm not allowed to have meaningful relationships with any of our family, since she restricts what I say and do and wear around them. I pointed out that she controls my clothes for like every family event, and this is my wedding, and she admitted that was a good point. Eventually, she agreed to attend the wedding in a really cute black and white checkerboard dress and leave if it became too much.

The wedding itself was incredible. It was the second-best day of my life so far and my sister said she was genuinely happy for me. I felt like a princess in a fairytale the whole day, and my husband was the handsomest prince in the universe. The whole thing was under the stars, it was perfect. I could talk about it forever, but character limits. As a wedding gift, my sister told me that she was going to start letting me wear what I liked at family gatherings, and talk about my accomplishments, AND talk about myself when it's just me and her a little. And she has, and it's been great. The only better gift I got that night was my husband himself.

This past year has been the best of my life, and I genuinely feel so much better about life and family these days. I'm a girlmom now, and I'm so glad my daughter gets to know her aunt and cousins too. I'm even allowed to babysit for my sister sometimes!

TL;DR: Everything really worked out, and it was a lot because this place helped me have confidence that I wasn't wrong. Thank you guys so much, and have a great new year!

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I am glad your wedding turned out lovely and your relationship with your family has improved! Well done, your hard work being a better sister and daughter has started to pay off!

>**OOP:** Thank you so much! Yeah, it's been really incredible. My mom even came to see a musical I was in this year, which is the first time she's done that since I was sixteen!

Commenter: How did you come to realize and value relationships?

>**OOP:** I've always valued relationships. I want to have people in my life, and I do love my family. I just didn't understand that me getting attention took away from other people. I really, really love attention, but I figured that was just a me thing, since other people get stuff like stage fright, or nerves talking to strangers or crushes, and a lot of people are shy or don't want to be center of attention. It didn't occur to me that the stuff I did was bad.

Commenter: I hope you’re not discouraged by some of these comments. It sounds like you’re on the right track to repairing your family and should keep it up. Given that your husband is also a narcissist, you should both work with therapists to make sure your narcissism doesn’t negatively impact your child - there’s a pretty big risk there, to be frank, especially if you are spending so much effort moderating your behavior in other areas of life.

>**OOP:** Already under advisement. We're doing everything we can to stay aware of what kids of narcissists can experience so we can avoid it. We both love her so, so much, and we'd never hurt her for the world.

Commenter: What were you wearing that your sister had to be in charge of your outfits???

>**OOP:** I like really long, flowy dresses, sort of a cottagecore princess vibe, with a lot of accessories and sparkly jewelry and stuff like that. Flowers in my hair and that kind of thing. It does show off my body though, and my sister says that's attention seeking and caused her to have an unhealthy relationship with food for a long time.

Commenter: Where did you get that NPD diagnosis from, and have you ever gotten a second opinion? Because this whole situation smells funny.

>**OOP:** I was professionally diagnosed! My current therapist agrees with that diagnosis.  
*OOP reiterates:*  
I do have my own therapist, and I really truly am a narcissist. Genuinely. If you met me you would understand.  
*OOP explains:*  
Actually, my sister's therapist helped with a lot of the boundaries!

Commenter: You understand that a diagnosis can be reached in error, yeah? A desire to ""recover"" from NPD is almost perfectly diagnostic for not actually having it. ""Other people are not like me; they have desires and needs that are different than my own"" is something you wouldn't find it possible to understand if you're genuinely a narcissist.

>**OOP:** I don't think that's true. I mean first off, a hallmark of the disorder is thinking you are \*not\* like other people, not that everyone is like you. Either you think you're way better or way worse or both.

*You're handling this well:*

>Thank you, I'm trying my best. My husband really helps! It's like, so amazing to have someone who just gets it, you know? I can walk up to him, sit in his lap, and be like, ""I want to sing you a whole musical right now,"" and he'll sit and listen and applaud whatever I want, and if he walks up to me and is like ""I'm going to read you this essay about how everyone but me is stupid"" I will listen and be delighted and in full agreement because he IS the smartest person. It makes everything easier because we get to be ourselves around each other and it's the best thing ever, AND we're both completely obsessed with our baby because she is the best baby to ever live.

Commenter: Do you ever worry you will get upset with your child like you do your friends? Like you said a friend made you sit in the back and you started thinking she was awful and you hated her until you realized you were overreacting. Do you worry how you will treat your daughter when she is old enough to talk back or tell you she hates you (she won’t mean it, all teens say it). Will you be able to love her when she is her own person and not just a reflection of you?

>**OOP:** That's one of my deepest fears honestly. I've got plans in place for how I'm supposed to react to everything but realistically things don't go according to plan. I love her so much, and I never want to hurt her. But if I ever do, I'll spend every moment trying to make it right, and I'll let her know from the start that Mommy isn't always right about everything, and sometimes Mommy makes mistakes, but she's always loved no matter what.

It was this one!

*One last thought:*

>I'll never not be a narcissist, but I'm trying my best to be a good person.

**Editor's note:** There are hundreds of comments from OOP. Most of the comments on the update are people arguing about whether or not she's a narcissist and what boundaries she should/shouldn't have. It's very interesting to hear OOP's perspectives, but I've already included many of her comments so don't want to make it too long. However, I'll include two more that detail some more of her past:

**OOP:** Okay you want to hear why I am a diagnosed narcissist? Let's go.

1. If I don't get attention, am alone too long, or cannot express everything in my mind to someone-- doesn't really matter who-- I can't feel anything. I just go numb. There's no happiness, no anger, no anything, just this vat of numbness that is unbearably dull and cannot be escaped until I have all eyes on me.
2. I genuinely believe I am the best at everything I do on an emotional level. I think I am a musical genius, and there's a bit to back that up, but I also think I'm a dancer on the level of at least any backup at a concert, that my drawings are good enough to be in a museum, that my writing is deep and ingenius, that I'm prettier than 99% of models even with the baby weight, that I can act well enough to win an Oscar if I was ever randomly put in a big budget movie for no reason... and I have nothing backing any of THAT up, except maybe the writing being slightly above average. My husband has told me that he agrees with the model thing and I have to put that in this reply.
3. The last time I failed-- full on failed-- it was at chemistry, and I temporarily became a full on antivaxxer because I decided chemistry was made up and stupid and nobody could ever really understand it and they were all just getting lucky and also evil. In reality I am not good at science. I still kind of resent scientists. I also decided that my teacher must be madly in love with me and punishing me for being so beautiful because he didn't want his wife to divorce him. That is how my mind works when I am not good at a thing.
4. I recently sat my husband down, told him that I had rewritten a whole musical to be about another character, and how it was so much better than the original. I one-woman showed both the original and then mine in front of him without even my piano and demanded he tell me in detail all the ways mine was better than the original. He has never seen the original or read the book it was based on first.
5. I will talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. Look at this post. Look how many hours I've spent talking about myself. In detail that's probably not the smartest. Because I am absolutely loving the attention. I've had four hour conversations in which the other person said maybe ten sentences max. My husband wants to inform you that it is more like ten words.
6. My friend had me sit in the backseat instead of shotgun while she took me and two other girls to a very expensive concert for her birthday and I decided she must secretly hate me and that she was boring and mean anyway and by the time we reached the show I was sure I'd go no-contact after, only to realize the shotgun friend was the only one not sitting next to her in the show and she was trying to be fair and immediately remembering that actually she's really smart and kind and fun and I love her. I told her all this to her face the next day and she said she could tell because she saw me glaring at her in the rearview mirror.
7. I throw a ball on my birthday. A literal ball. We save up all year and I get a fancy dress and rent a ballroom. I make my friends call me ""Princess \[my name\] and pretend to be my ladies in waiting. The princess thing is actually pretty consistent in my life. I have tea parties at least once a month too.

I am not a poor little meow meow with a misdiagnosis. I'm a person who has more than one personality trait, and honestly I don't like that so many people want to say it's wrong, because my husband has the same diagnosis and so do a lot of my close friends, and they're the people I am able to be myself around best, and who most understand me. It hurts to hear them disparaged even if you're trying to uplift me in the process.

*How the husband relationship works:*

>Well, my husband and I just each see the other as an extension of ourselves, and we love each other. I have a princess complex, he has a hero complex, we require the other to fulfill that. For our friends, there's definitely some competition there, but there's also a lot of mutual enjoyment. One of my friends is a pretty famous influencer, and she's great to have around, because she gets us VIP treatment everywhere. She took the pictures for my wedding! We do fashion together, and I get a steady stream of promotion gifts from her because we have very different coloring and what looks good on me almost always looks not as good on her. And vice versa, I suppose. Another of my NPD friends is an alto and I'm a soprano, and so we're usually going for different roles in musicals. Basically, as long as we each have a defined niche, we can agree our group in total is the best and each of us is the best at our role. I'm the best blonde soprano musician in the group and I don't mind if other people are the best at their own thing, because I don't do social media/sing alto/whatever else.",1hzfadq,n/a,2025-01-12 05:00:24
CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,"Making a child eat everything on their plate will in one way or another damage someone's view on food.   

I have seen this outcome often and it's usually expressed in a few ways:

1. People don't stop eating when they are full. I don't want to offend anyone but a lot of the people I know who struggle with their weight been brought up in homes where they weren't allowed to leave the table until they had cleaned their plates. 
2. Meal time becomes a chore or downright unpleasant. When I went to stay with my father and his partner she would make me eat everything on my plate, I didn't portion the food out myself and it was often food that she wouldn't eat and that I hated. Meal time became me taking an hour to eat something because I was gagging between bites. I know people who are very picky eaters because they were forced as children to eat food that made them feel sick.
3. People who have small appetites will portions out less for themselves because being hungry is better than feeling sick.  
4. It creates fear of going without ""if you don't finish you won't get anything else"" can sound like ""I'm going to punish you for not finishing by leave you out""  
5. It makes someone a picky eater, you're going to stick to what you like if you're going to be made to eat all of it. 
6. Food becomes a reward ""if you eat everything you'll get dessert"" this creates two problems, for some people it's ""I've been good I can have this"" and for some people it's ""I haven't been good enough so I can't have this"" 
7. It can cause a dislike for certain foods, sometimes to the point of a phobia. In the same household I was often fed soggy, fatty bacon that was cooked in a microwave, if I even smell bacon cooking it makes me feel sick and this is more than a decade later. I have encountered this with many people I know who can't stand different dishes or ingredients.

Instead a child should be encouraged to try everything more than once without the pressure to eat all of it and if they genuinely don't like it then that's ok, also if a child doesn't manage to finish then they can eat it another day.

Baristas Have A Weird Relationship With Food,"So every single cafe I have ever worked at has had one thing in common.

Break times roll around and you tell your fellow barista it's time for their break. You ask what they're having for lunch and they say ""Ah nothing. I don't really eat."" You ask if they had a big breakfast. ""Nah I don't eat breakfast."" Oh they're planning something for dinner? ""Nope.""

First place I worked at has multiple baristas just work ten hour shifts with nothing.

Second place I worked at has two guys who insisted they didn't need a proper lunch. One of them I knew didn't have breakfast, I *never ever* saw him drink a sip of water (I worked with him for forty+ hours a week for years) and he would have the tiniest bowl of cereal for lunch.

Third place has again had multiple people who just smoke?? They insist that they don't need a proper break. Just several smoke breaks.

Tbh I find this pretty bonkers. Why does this seem to be such a common thing with baristas??",180d8pd,n/a,2023-11-21 09:34:21
J.R.'s unhealthy relationship with food and his physique,"I just finished S3E4 and the way J.R. talks about fitness seems like a red flag. Did anyone else notice this? The two things that screamed out to me were the fact that he wants to bring a scale to their restaurant dates, and an ice breaker question he asked Sandy is ""what is your ideal celebrity body type."" 

I see some patterns with disordered eating behaviors and thats very worrisome. Not being able to enjoy food without a scale isn't a healthy way to live. Additionally, the thought process of coveting another persons body is worrisome. Sandy is very slim and fit so asking her who she would want to look like seems insulting. He mentioned he wants to look like Chris Hemsworth, and I wonder if he won't ever stop comparing himself to someone else. 

I worry that this can be triggering for people who are struggling with eating disorders and body dysmorphia. I also hope that if he has this struggle himself he can get the help he needs, hopefully before pushing these views on someone else. What do you think? ",1i8irxo,n/a,2025-01-24 00:35:53
Breakthrough: It wasn’t the rice. It was my relationship with food,"For months I blamed rice. I tried cutting it, swapping it, hating it. But I’d always binge after a week, then feel awful Then one day I ate rice just one cup, slowly, with veggies and grilled tilapia and I felt full. Satisfied, not guilty. That was the moment it clicked: the problem wasn’t the rice. It was how I used food to reward, punish, distract, escape.

Since then, I’ve lost 6kg and I haven’t cut out anything, just started listening more.

I shared this in WeightLossPhilippines and it turns out… a lot of us are going through the same quiet realizations. You don’t have to do it alone.",1kcylzh,n/a,2025-05-02 11:29:18
“I think you need to try intuitive eating and fix your relationship with food cause you’re still weird around it”,"Look, I get my friend is trying to be nice and all, but I put on weight RAPIDLY when I’m not being mindful about what I eat and don’t exercise. She keeps encouraging me to treat myself with fast food/desserts when I don’t even crave them anymore, and I have a LEGIT PREDISPOSITION FOR BEING OBESE! My entire family was highly addicted to fast food and highly processed foods, and they developed TERRIBLE health consequences because of it. She also encourages me to drink alcohol, but I HATE drinking for multiple reasons and feel really anxious when I’m drinking (I’ll admit I’m down to smoke, but even then I RARELY do it because of all my families health complications). She’s like “I get it, but you don’t want to be the one person not drinking/eating the food” and it pisses me off because she KNOWS that I can’t just moderate it. I can’t just have ONE slice of pizza, I have to have the whole thing plus a slice of cake with ice cream and cookies, and while it can be linked to emotions, it’s also because I’m quite literally addicted. Even as a child when I came home from school, I would binge on highly processed foods and wouldn’t exercise. I’ve found that abstinence has made my life better, and even with weight maintenance/bulking, I gravitate to Whole Foods because it just makes me feel better. Idk, I just wanted to rant on here because frankly the idea of binge drinking + eating highly processed foods doesn’t sound like my idea of a good time- what does is going boating, having the energy to enjoy the outdoors, rollerblading, painting in the park, ect. And while you can definitely bring food into it, why does it have to be highly processed stuff that makes you feel like shit?!",14t9047,n/a,2023-07-07 14:33:38

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/i_caught_my_twin_doing_something_but_she_says_its/)**: September 27, 2024**

Okay so I’m 15 and a female, but the one with symptoms is my twin sister who is also 15. We are fraternal if that makes a difference. She’s 5’5.5 and she was 135 pounds at the start of cross country season when we got our physicals but she’s visibly smaller now and I don’t know what she weighs anymore. For medical history, she gets migraines and has medicine for that.

So we are twins and we look super similar, it’s obvious we are twins, but I’ve always been shorter and skinnier. I was a lot smaller than her at birth and basically never caught up lmao. But that’s the only real difference physically. She always liked being the taller one because she’s 3 minutes older too. When we got our physicals in July though, she got super upset that I weighed 113 pounds and she was 135. She’s also two and a half inches taller than me though and the doctor said our weights were totally perfect. The doctor could tell she was upset and told her not to worry about her weight because she looks beautiful and she’s healthy, and she said she wasn’t worried but I could tell she was lying. And honestly the night before we had eaten at this Greek restaurant with massive portions and it was probably poop weight. Not to be gross. But yeah.

A couple days later she asked our mom to buy grapefruit. Our mom is well meaning and overall a really good mom but she did modeling when she was younger and she’s a complete almond mom. Like she’s always on a diet and talking about how fat she is when she’s not. So she was super happy that Isabel wanted to eat healthier. Isabel explained this whole diet plan of only eating good foods and being super healthy. It sounded stupid to me but I wanted to be supportive. She said she wanted to get to 125. Which her weight before was fine but that was still pretty reasonable so I tried to be supportive.

She went unhinged. She started watching nutrition influencers on TikTok and insta. So she started off eating this diet of grapefruit and coffee for breakfast, a salad and half a cup of dry cheerios at lunch, and grilled chicken breast with honey mustard and grapes for dinner. After like two weeks of this I found her in our closet eating an entire sleeve of Oreos and a plate of nachos and a tortilla covered in melted chocolate chips, and she was sobbing. I told her she wasn’t eating enough and that’s why her brain made her do that. I helped her clean up and we went for a walk and I thought she was done with the diet, but then she was searching “how to prevent binges” which lead her to following this instagram model named Caroline Deisler, or something like that. Anyway she’s a vegan and then my sister decided this is her goal body and she’s going to be vegan too. My mom was super supportive of this. Over the last two months the amount she’s eating keeps getting less and less. Now she’s living off almost exclusively fruit and honey roasted almonds and coconut yogurt, with the occasional lemon juice and olive oil salad. She told my mom she doesn’t want “bad” food in the house. This sucks for me because I don’t want to live off of rabbit food, but also I’m really worried about my sister.

Shes doing some really weird stuff with her food. She chews everything so long it must be paste, she uses tiny plates for everything and refuses to eat off red or yellow plates, and she spends ages arranging her food in patterns. She won’t eat if she can’t drink water with it. She also barely goes to stuff with our friends and me anymore and she says it’s because she’s tired or has homework but she mostly avoids things that involve eating so I feel like that’s probably what she’s actually doing. Her times at cross country keep getting worse instead of better and she looks miserable when we’re running and she’s so angry lately, and I’m pretty sure it’s because she’s hungry. I keep telling my mom I think something isn’t right and she tells me jealousy is an ugly look.

So this all leads us to last Friday. We were at a football game with friends, and I forgot to charge my phone. I wanted to show one of our friends the dress I was wearing for homecoming because she wasn’t in the group chat, so I took my sisters phone. I opened her pictures to find the dress and there were pictures of her that she took in her underwear but they didn’t look like nudes, it was like she was trying to see how bony she was. And she looks awful. But I knew she would be embarrassed if our friend saw this and so I closed out of photos and opened safari to just Google the store I bought the dress at and it opened to this forum about eating disorders. I pretended I didn’t see it, I looked up the dress, and then I gave my sister her phone and tried not to act weird all night. So then in bed later I looked the site up.

It’s awful. It’s seriously awful. It’s people talking about losing weight and having competitions and posting their skinny bodies and wanting to be unhealthy. They share tips on not eating and eating less and not getting caught. I don’t know what my sisters username was, I didn’t have time to see so I couldn’t find her profile, but no one on the site was healthy. I was crying reading it because it’s freaking awful.

So the next day when we were walking home from the gas station I offered her some of my bar, and she said no. I asked again and she said no, she just wanted her Celsius. And I told her I thought she needed to eat something. She flipped out at me and told me to stop being pushy and weird and I told her I found the website. At first she said she was researching for a school project and I was like “Izzy what project we have all the same classes”. She got super pissed at me and she’s barely been talking to me all week and said if I tell anyone she’ll never talk to me again.

I looked up eating disorders. I’m not trying to make this about me but it says they can be really bad for you and make you infertile. It looks like a big deal. And not eating can kill you right? People die of that. I’ve been an absolute mess for the last week thinking about this. She’s ignoring me acting like everything is fine and eating almost nothing.

I’m sorry this got so long. I just don’t know what to do…she told me to let it go because she’s fine and just being healthier and she’ll increase her food when cross country season is done because she can’t run if she’s full. But that sounds…stupid. She told me everyone diets, our mom has literally always been in a diet, pretty much everyone in our friend group has been on a diet or tried to lose weight and I’m overreacting. This is the only place I knew I could ask doctors about this without having to tell them who I am.

Could this make my sister sick or even kill her? Is it my fault because I’m smaller and she felt bad? How can I help her? She’s so angry and so mean lately and I’m really scared for her. I don’t want her to get hurt but I also don’t want her to hate me.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: if your mother won't help with this I'd get another trusted family member to help as well. This can be dangerous and sounds like an ED. You're a great sister for worrying about her and seeking help.

>**OOP:** Is it dangerous enough to call our dad over? He’s like a Christmas/birthday dad

Commenter: \[...\] You said your dad is a Christmas dad so I don't know how he can help being so far away but I'd consider reaching out to dad if your mom is unreasonable or minimizes what's happening.

>**OOP:** That’s the worst part he’s not far away- we just only see him on our birthday and Christmas lmao. He lives like 2 miles away. I’ll try to find a time to talk to my mom when my sister isn’t around. The times I’ve brought it up when she’s around in the past they both accuse me of being dramatic and jealous. Plus my sister threatened to tell our mom I’ve vaped a couple times if I brought it up again 😬

Commenter: You need to find another adult that's dependable. It doesn't sounding your dad is that present in your life

It doesn't sound like your mom cares enough or is too ignorant or just wants to cover her eyes and pretend everything is OK

>**OOP:** My parents are super young and kind of immature. They’re both 33 and 32 so I try not to be too hard on them…like at least they didn’t delete us I guess? But also I kind of think maybe my mom has problems too and actually thinks it’s normal? I’ve just been really anxious trying to figure this out and I’m afraid something bad will happen to my sister if she keeps doing this

Commenter: I don't blame you at all but they need to fucking grow the fuck up and be parents. You say you're 15.... so your parents had you at 18 and 17 respectively and I am assuming they are divorced or never married since they don't live together and your deadbeat \[and I'm being kind here\] dad isn't around enough to notice the problem or care. \[...\]

>**OOP:** They’re not really bad or abusive but I think my mom almost sees us more like we’re all the same age than that she’s our mom? But yeah I really wish she’d be more of an adult at least for this

Commenter: Do you have any other adults in your life that you trust that could help? An aunt or uncle, grandparents or teacher?

>**OOP:** We don’t talk to my mom’s side of the family since we were like 5. My dad’s parents we know but not super well. But they’re not bad or anything so I think they might help. My sister seems like she really likes our math teacher. Would it be weird if told her?

Commenter: I feel this. I'm a twin too, we are identical. My sister has had a lot of ups and downs with her mental health and it's the worst feeling to be there seeing it and not be able to fix it. Wondering why is she hurting so much when I am (comparatively) ok? Thinking that if I just tried harder I could somehow save her from this. It's not fair, but know that you can't fix this for her, you can just be there supporting her as she goes through treatment.

>**OOP:** Yes that’s exactly it. Like I feel so guilty that she’s having this issue and I’m not… and then I wonder if it’s genetic and I’ll end up like that too? I don’t want to. And usually she’s always been honest with me and we don’t have secrets but she’s pulling away and saying we need space and our own lives now…

**OOP:** Tonight she’s been using this stepper thing to step up and down while we are watching a show and I didn’t say anything because I don’t want to make her suspicious or more mad, but then she kind of tripped on it and sat down and put her head in her lap and said she was going to throw up. I had her lay down and got her some water and a bucket but she’s all sweaty and said she doesn’t feel good and thinks she has a stomach thing…but could this be from her not eating? Is there a different way to help if she’s sick than if it’s because of the eating stuff? I was rubbing her back and it’s all bumpy and boney and I’m really freaked out

*Blood sugar:*

Our mom is asleep. I had to argue with her to get her to suck on a jolly rancher. Hopefully it helps the blood sugar thing if that’s it

**OOP:** This morning she thanked me for helping her last night and told me she knows she’s being stupid and said she’d stop and begged me not to say anything. She promised she’d eat more and stop being weird about stuff. I don’t know if I should give her the chance or tell anyway…if I give her a chance and she doesn’t go through with it could something bad happen in that time?

**OOP:** I sent our cross country coach a text and asked if we can go get smoothies or something later. Hopefully she doesn’t think that’s weird. I just don’t want to talk where my sister might hear. She said she was going to do better and then she ate carrots for lunch

**Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpf4qv7/:)**: 7 hours later, about 24 from OG post**

**OOP:** Earlier this afternoon my sister fainted like a half hour after she took a shower and she wasn’t answering or waking up and so I freaked out and called an ambulance and she woke up by the time they got there but she couldn’t see anything at first and she hit her head. So now she’s mad at me and won’t let me see her and my moms mad because she said we could’ve just made a doctor appointment if I told her instead of going over her head and making a scene but I knew this was bad. And I know it’s horrible but I hope they don’t let her leave the hospital until she’s better. Thanks for answering my questions. I probably would’ve been too scared to call 911 otherwise. I knew she wasn’t okay.

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: You absolutely, unequivocally, did the right thing.  

If you are able to, I think it might be a good idea to reach out to the team that is seeing your sister and disclose this information. If you are worried about your relationship with her, you can ask them to please not tell her that you said this. She may very well try to hide her recent weight loss and her eating habits from her doctors, and it is incredibly important that they know about this. They may already suspect it or know it based on her presentation, but having your collateral information will be very helpful

>**OOP:** The doctors at the hospital you mean? The paramedics asked me what happened and I told them I think she’s not eating on purpose and she’s lost a lot of weight. Would they know because of that or would I have to tell them again? Also the paramedics said her pulse was low, and her blood pressure. I don’t remember the blood pressure numbers but her pulse was 41. Is that why she fainted?

Commenter: Her heart rate is likely due to nutrition issues and low electrolytes. Either way I'm glad you called the ambulance and took her to the hospital

You're handing this as well as you can and saved her life.

Where are your parents in this? Surely they must know now.

>**OOP:** My mom knows. She’s here too. I called my dad and he was mad no one told him sooner

**Comment** [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lph1fmd/:)**: September 29, 2024 (Next day, day and a half from OG post)**

Commenter: Nothing to apologize for. This isn’t your fault and you’re the only person in her life who recognizes this for the emergency that it is. Your mom and friends are gaslighting you and only enabling her restrictive eating and delaying her from getting help.

I’m a critical care physician.  
Every once in a while someone like your sister comes to the ICU with life threatening complications from starvation. Everything you just described is very alarming. Can’t say medically if she has caused any significant or permanent damage to her body. She will reach that point If this continues. I think she needs help far beyond what friends, family and even her pediatrician can provide.this is they type of thing that requires everything from social workers, psychiatry, psychotherapy and an experienced pediatrician to really get her what she needs.

Is there is anyone in her life besides your mom who uou can confide in? Could be a coach, a trusted teacher, guidance counselor, religious leader. I know you don’t want to go against your sister, but she isn’t in a state where she can make rational decisions for herself. She needs your help.

>**OOP:** Thank you for this. It was a really long night just waiting. But she got admitted and finally said I could come be with her. I told the doctor everything I knew. She won’t eat anything. I called my dad and he and my mom are fighting about how she got this way. She said she doesn’t want everyone to be mad but she can’t eat

**OOP:** She got admitted here. There’s a lot of blood labs and they’re been trying to convince her to eat but she either doesn’t or she takes it and then flushes it down the toilet. I’ve been trying to tell them everything I can think of that might matter. I don’t understand why she’s doing this and I’m starting to feel kind of mad which I know it’s not her fault but it’s so hard to watch

Has she seen psychiatry yet?

Are your parents actually starting to comprehend how serious this is? Or do they need another verbal splash of cold water?

>**OOP:** My dad does. My mom just keeps pleading with her and suggesting giving her salads because it would be easier. The doctor said she’s going to get a tube in her nose if she won’t start eating. I’m not sure if she’s seen psychiatry, she’s seen a few people that I had to leave the room for

**Title:** What does an NG tube feel like? How long does it stay?

Hi. I’m 15 and female, so is my twin sister who this is about. She wasn’t eating and lost a lot of weight. She’s 5’5.5 and about 105 pounds. She lost 30 pounds in 2 months. Now she’s in the hospital because she fainted but it’s been a couple days and she refuses to eat and keeps trying to pinch her IV and the doctor said she’s getting an NG tube. I had questions about everything but I didn’t want to ask them in front of her and scare her or have her doctor think I was being nosy or rude, so I wanted to ask here since last time everyone was helpful.

What does an NG tube feel like?

How long does it stay in?

Will she be able to mess with it?

Why is she just completely refusing everything now? Why doesn’t she just eat?

When I was researching anorexia, which is what the doctor said she has, I saw it’s genetic. Does that mean I could end up like her too?

How long do you stay in the hospital for anorexia? I miss her being home with me.

***Top Comment:***

**DrSocialDeterminants:** It can stay for quite a while. I've seen people leave it for days. That said, she can yank it out at great pain to herself.

I also remember your story as I was one of the docs that posted a response. I'm sorry to see she's still struggling. It's clear from your posts and updates that my concerns were correct and that she's very sick

I would estimate she needs weeks to recover physically from how malnourished she is to get her stable enough to not collapse walking out of the hospital. However, I'm truly concerned that she's a suicide risk to herself as she's shown that even in the hospital, her refusal to eat would be dangerous. I suspect that she will likely be transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility to get more intensive therapy and potentially medications to address her other mental health concerns.

She's in it for the long haul. That said, even after discharge she will likely need years or therapy and support. She will always have a lingering struggle with food and body dysmorphia. She has a great sister to help support her though and that will be helpful in her recovery.

I don't know the evidence for the genetic risks of eating disorders. We know that sometimes family history is important for things like depression and anxiety but thisnisnt my specialty. More importantly, it doesn't mean you're doomed to have this. I would instead focus my efforts on the environment.... thinking of how to have a healthy relationship with food and your body.

I remember your earlier post about her getting upset that you weighed less. She was also getting her mom to support her dieting. You also said you mom constantly says that she's overweight herself and diets despite not needing to. The first thing for your sister is to work through why she's competing with you regarding weight. Honestly though... if your mom constantly says things like she has, then frankly she needs to stop as that's so unhealthy to say that it definitely can contribute to body shaming and displeasure at your body image.

Hi…This is my third post. I’m really sorry. I’m just so scared and I don’t know who else to ask because hospital doctors won’t tell me much.

My twin sister is 15 and female. She went on this insane diet that turned into anorexia and she lost 30 pounds in two months. Then she fainted and got admitted to the hospital. She wouldn’t eat there either so they put a tube in her. She wouldn’t drink anything but she gets fluids in an IV. So now she’s just refusing to sleep. Because they can’t put that in a tube I guess. But all she does is cry and ask me the same questions over and over like if I’m mad at her and if I love her.

She had a seizure a few days back which was really scary. I don’t understand why she’s doing this and I’m really scared that she’s not sleeping on purpose. What happens if you don’t sleep?? Will you get sick? Can her doctors make her sleep? I don’t understand why she keeps refusing to do basic things. She can’t go to treatment until she’s stable and she says she wants to leave the hospital but it’s like she’s trying to die

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Hi. Dont be sorry about your questions, ask as many as you like!

When someone doesn’t sleep for a while, it can mess with them... like making them feel confused or really sad or make it harder for the body to fight off bad things.

The doctors know what is best for her, and i promise that she is very good hands.  
They might have ways to get her to sleep, even if it means giving her some meds for a bit. They’re watching her closely, trust me - especially since she had a seizure.

I know you’re scared and it’s totally okay and totally normal to feel that way. stay close to your sister, even if she seems distant, that can mean a lot for both of u. and dont forget yourself. if you can, talk to some adult you trust, maybe some of the doctors/nurses?

All the best to both of you.

>**OOP:** I think it is making her feel really sad. She cries almost constantly. She keeps biting her lip to keep herself awake I guess, but it’s swollen and bloody. And when I ask her why she’s doing this and tell her it’s okay to sleep because I’m here too she just says she can’t

Commenter: I just want to chime in here and say that your sister is not doing this to herself, she has a serious illness that results in behavioural changes. Your sister's brain registers food as a threat and she is responding to it in this way. I have seen people with eating disorders force themselves to stay awake because it may burn ever so slightly more calories, or in hospital, are afraid that if they fall asleep, someone may increase feeds/add something to them/push a bolus through, etc.

Some people find it helpful to conceptualise the anorexia as separate to their loved one- or view anorexia as a ""terrorist"" who has taken their loved one hostage. Take care of yourself, and if you have capacity, spend time with your sister so you both remember who she is without the illness.

>**OOP:** I’ve been playing cards with her, and brought our switches, and we are still doing our book club that we’ve done since we were in second grade. I pretty much try not to talk about it unless she brings it up because I don’t want her to feel like I forgot her.

Commenter: You are doing all the right things! Keep on being you, and don’t forget to rest and recuperate yourself - this experience will be just as traumatising for you so be kind to yourself.

I wonder if reiterating to her that you will protect her while she’s asleep, that you won’t let anyone touch her. Maybe holding her will help soothe her enough?

>**OOP:** She just keeps saying she’s too cold to sleep and she wants to go home

**Title:** How much medicine do you give patients in the hospital? Is my sister lying?

My sister is in the hospital for anorexia. She’s 15. She lost a lot of weight and she got a tube in her nose because she wouldn’t eat. It feels like everything has gotten worse since we came here, like being in the hospital made her sicker, and it’s my fault she’s here because I’m the one who called an ambulance on her. But I think I caught her lying about stuff again…

In her bag she has a ton of pills all in one of the pockets. I found them looking for her chapstick. I asked her about it and first she said it was Tylenol but I told her it doesn’t look like it and there’s more than one kind. Then she said they are just her prescription but she dropped the bottle and it broke so she put them in the pocket. But here’s the thing…it’s different kinds. There’s only one kind in a prescription right? So she’s lying? She’s just not taking anything they give her and she’s putting it in her bag? I thought in the hospital they only give you your medicine for the day, not the whole prescription.

I don’t want to tell on her if she’s telling the truth and make her more mad at me and not trust me but it feels like she’s lying. I know some of the medicine is for sleeping and some is for depression. I don’t know about the other one. If she’s not taking it could it hurt her? Is it worth telling them about?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: She might be stashing the ones the hospital gives her. You need to tell her care team about this. Stashing pills is a warning sign.

>**OOP:** A warning sign for what? It feels like she doesn’t want to get better. It’s like she’s sabotaging everything

Commenter: *it feels like she doesn’t want to get better* yes, that’s what mental illness does. She’s in the right place with people who can medically take care of her, you did the right thing bringing her in.

Stashing pills can mean she might be planning to take them all at once to unalive herself. Please tell her care team.

>**OOP:** Fuck. Okay. Thank you. Fuck this sucks.  
*(later to the same commenter):*  
Sorry I shouldn’t have swore that much it’s rude and it wasn’t at you

*How OOP feels:*

It’s so stupid and if I think about it I feel angry so I just don’t so I can’t feel anything. I hate this. I don’t know why she’s doing this when she was fine a few months ago.

*Treatment center:*

She’s not even in a treatment place yet. They won’t take her because she isn’t stable. She’s in a normal hospital

*She needs to be kept under constant observation:*

A nurse was watching her because she kept messing with her tube, but she stopped doing that I think so they weren’t with her all the time the last couple days. But I told the nurse anyway about the medicine and she said she’d take care of it. It feels like the hospital is making her worse

**Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g22key/comment/lrq3c3u/)**: October 13, 2024 (Next Day)**

The doctor came and asked about the pills. She had prescription water pills that weren’t hers, the sleeping medicine they’ve been giving her and thinking she’s been taking, and a stimulant. She won’t say where she got the prescription ones that weren’t hers.

The doctor told her they check all patients bags periodically if they come for mental health so thankfully she doesn’t know it was me that told on her. I asked why she’s doing this and she said she doesn’t know and keeps apologizing.

I keep switching between being mad and being heartbroken. It’s hard to figure out how to feel when it seems like she’s doing it herself. I know she’s not. But there’s nothing tangible like a tumor or bad blood lab to blame and it’s hard to wrap my head around. Sometimes I don’t want to be here with her.

She told me she’s afraid they’re going to make her overweight and I’ll always be the prettier one and I don’t know how to respond to that stuff so I told her I’d like her no matter what and maybe I can eat a bunch of cake so I can be bigger and she can push me around in a scooter. I just miss her. My parents won’t talk about it other than blaming each other. My friends just want all the juicy details.

I’m sorry for rambling so much…it’s just that there isn’t anywhere else anyone actually listens. I know she’s the one that’s sick and not me but it’s really hard.

*Comments:*

Commenter: I wanna give you a hug, you’re a sweetie and you deserve just as much care as you give others

>**OOP**: I would totally take it. I don’t think anyone has hugged me since she got admitted. It’s like I’m invisible now

Commenter: It can help to create some distance by remembering that it's the eating disorder that gets mad and doesn't want to get better. Behind that wall your sister is just sad, scared and sick. \[...\]

>**OOP:** I’ve been trying to think of it like that. Or like she’s possessed. We’re Catholic lmao. But I just want her to be okay.

*Getting therapy:*

>My mom accused me of making it all about myself and my dad asked if I was going to starve myself too and if he should buy a second headstone when I asked about therapy but I found an online ai thingy that’s a little helpful

Commenter: Frankly your mom's been in denial the whole time, which is ironic since she's probably a reason that contributed to your sister since you said your mom is superficial about body image.

Your dad is out of line and what a rude thing to say.

>**OOP:** I think he just can’t handle both of us being needy at the same time. He doesn’t really get why she’s doing this either

I’m a 15 year old female. So is my twin sister, of course. She is really sick with anorexia. It started at the end of the summer and went downhill fast, she lost 30 pounds, and she’s in the hospital with a tube in her nose fighting every attempt to help her. It’s like she’s two people. And i don’t understand at all but she said she doesn’t know why she’s doing it either.

I’ve been researching anorexia to try and understand and see how I can help her and I keep seeing article mentioning how there’s a genetic component. At first I kept thinking “that could never happen to me” but my sister thought the same thing and I don’t think anyone tries to be anorexic… I skipped meals a couple days and then tried fasting for a few to see if I could understand why she’s doing this and I guess i sort of felt proud that I was able to stick with the diet but it didn’t feel so good I would want to slowly kill myself in front of everyone I love over it….is there a chance this could happen to me too? As in am I at a higher risk of also ending up like her because of the genetic part? If so, is there anything I can do to prevent it? Watching her is so scary. It’s not even her anymore. She’s been swallowed up by the anorexia.

As a side note also…is there anything I can do to help her?

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gokcju/can_you_accidentally_make_yourself_anorexic/) **6: November 10, 2024**

**Title:** Can you accidentally make yourself anorexic?

I’m 15, female, 5’3 and 104 pounds.

A bit over a month ago my twin sister got diagnosed with anorexia. She’s in a hospital now and getting better. I was really afraid when she got diagnosed that I would end up like that because I read it was genetic. I didn’t understand at all, I’ve never cared about my body and I still don’t…but I feel like I’ve been fixating on not becoming anorexic so much that I’m actually creating a problem. I went from 113 to 104 in the last month.

I keep getting scared that I’m not eating enough so then I go and eat a lot, like panic eating to try and not under eat and I est so much that I feel sick and embarrassed and gross and at first I was trying to run it off but then I realized I could just throw it up….and I started doing that. I know it’s not good, obviously. And it’s super gross.

But does this mean I’m accidentally making myself anorexic because of how hard I’m trying to avoid it? I don’t care about my weight…I’m not trying to lose weight but I keep losing it anyway. I’m just stuck in this cycle where I feel scared that I’m not eating enough and I suddenly need to set everything but then after I feel so horrible and I want it gone. My mom keeps seeing that I’m eating a ton and telling me I don’t have to eat for me and my sister and that I’m going to get diabetes…I feel like this isn’t good but I don’t know who to ask about this because it’s going to sound so stupid when my sister was literally almost dead from starving herself to ask if I have an issue.

There are a lot of ways that we can have a difficult relationship with food, and you have been through an ENORMOUS amount of stress in the last few months. What you are doing, as you guessed, is not healthy and can become an eating disorder on its own if you don’t get help. But the earlier you get help, the better the outcome. Can you ask your mom to get your own therapist ? If she’s not open to it, could you talk to a social worker at school or maybe at the hospital where your sister is?

>**OOP:** Hi. I remember you too. I feel kind of stupid asking to see a therapist because I don’t want anyone to think I’m copying her or that I want attention :/ I’m really not, but it’s like it I can’t stop thinking about it and I forgot how I used to eat without thinking. But the place my sister is at had a sibling support group that I go to, maybe the therapist who leads it could help?

Commenter: I just saw the sentence about the sibling support group, sorry! Yes, absolutely! Go talk to the therapist! I’m sure that you will not be the first sibling needing more help. I really think this is the best thing you can do.

>**OOP:** I’m going to ask tonight if she can recommend anyone I could see and if she’d help me tell my parents

*How sis is doing:*

Thank you. My sister is doing a lot better. She’s a lot less angry, and she talks about different stuff now. I feel like I completely forgot how I used to eat without thinking before and I forget to eat and then panic that I’m not eating enough and then overeat and then want it gone. I haven’t been feeling hungry at all. I’m hoping you’re right that when it’s further away it’ll be easier. I’m afraid I’m going to make things worse for my sister too if I start doing this. She already told me I look skinnier last time I visited :/

**Editor's note:** OOP comment on this post on November 22, 2024

Hi. So this is about me. I just wanted to say my sister is okay. She’s not worse anyway. She still doesn’t really want to get better though because she doesn’t think anything is wrong. But physically she’s getting better I think. She looks better to me. Also I’m okay. I figured out how to stop throwing up. I made myself a meal plan and if I follow it I don’t feel super chaotic and anxious and I don’t end up doing that stuff.

"Anyone else working on having a healthier relationship with food, not just a “better” diet?","  
Lately, I’ve realized that knowing *what* to eat isn’t the hard part — it’s *how* I think about food that really needed work.

For years I bounced between strict tracking and total chaos. Now I’m trying to eat more mindfully, listen to my body, and stop labeling food as “good” or “bad.” It’s surprisingly difficult to unlearn that black-and-white thinking.

Has anyone else been on this kind of journey? What helped you shift from just chasing macros or weight loss goals to actually building a more balanced mindset around food?",1l4yiuk,n/a,2025-06-06 17:39:15
[Mcu] thanos obsessively insists famine is the cause of all misery because of his species' relationship with food.,"If thanos cut all living populations in half, humanity would repopulate in under 200 years, assuming of course our planet didn't suffer a massive ecological collapse due to the extinction of eusocial organisms like bees that depend on their numbers.  Yet thanos adamantly thinks culling a population like a herd of deer will solve all their problems.  

Interestingly, our own species outlived stronger and more intimidating relatives like neanderthals with their bruce lee esque strength, denisovans with their big robust skeletons and barrel chests, and god knows what else that didn't make it into the fossil record.  (We even have fossils of some genetic mutant race split from our own species, called boskop men, who apparently had bigger, smarter brains, and a short run of survival in south-central africa)

As far as we know, we survived by adopting some kind of weird almost-r-strategist survival tactic.  

Our bodies are disproportinately weak and cheap to grow for a species our size, we can subsist on nearly anything, we quickly metabolize fat, and our incredibly slow growing young force us to band together en masse, unlike the neanderthals who reached maturity at 15.

Ancient pre neolithic structures like gobekli tepe even suggest that we had absolutely obscene and competent populations long before the time we believe the agricultural revolution to have occurred in.

I suggest thanos's species evolved for the **exact opposite** niche.  Extreme k strategy, impossible feats of individual strength and survivability, and as a result, a titan population needs an unimaginable amount of calories to survive.

While humans define the progression of hamlet to village to town to city by the logistic concerns that naturally arise from growing population, the titans were able to flourish with small numbers alone, and erect structures with far less need for factory machinery and tools.  Their strength cut countless steps of production in nearly every area. They never adapted to see the social threats to survival that could be provided by fellow sapient creatures because they didn't survive their first major population boom.",geew7n,n/a,2020-05-06 06:42:04
I hear people who are successful with weightloss changed their relationship with food. What does that mean? ,"Even when not hungry if I crave hot Cheetos or chocolate, I will eat it. Some  times I can’t tell the difference between hungry or just want to eat. Most times I’m aware I’m craving something I don’t really need or I’m just wanting to eat bc bored or habit (like eating while watching shows) but still do it. 

HOW is the relationship with food changed with ppl successful? ",1h1j13m,n/a,2024-11-28 00:11:20
I don’t know who needs to hear this but giving a kid snacks whenever they’re sad is creating a horrible relationship with food. ,"I was with my brother and his kids this weekend. Every time his kids cried he would give them cookies, an apple sauce, etc. He kept laughing saying “it’s the only thing that works”. I’m shocked at how casual he was about teaching his kids that food = comfort. ",1hpz98b,n/a,2024-12-30 22:22:29
My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"My gf (F29) and I (M29) have been together for about 7 years. She was never really an especially slim girl but over the years she's gradually gotten further and further away from that.

Now, as much as I hate to admit it or put it in such a blunt way, I think she's now overweight.

There's a few trends I've noticed in the way she approaches food and general health and they're concerning because she reinforces and defends them instead of taking advice into consideration.

She eats her feelings. This is exactly as it sounds but she's a very emotional person and most variances from the norm lead to eating some type of snack. Tonight she was upset about something from work and tried for about half an hour to convince me to take her to McDonald's for a sundae and has gotten upset with me in the past for saying no.

This leads into the next issue. She pulls me into her binges. She doesn't like going out for snacks like these without me. I think she feels like my approval absolves her of responsibility for her decision. Unfortunately if I say no, she gets upset with me and she tends to not let it go unless I either cave in or leave. She does the same thing with snacks she makes at home because she'll make 2 and give me 1 without asking if I'm interested. She'll then get mad at me for ""wasting food"" if I don't partake.

This is problematic for my fitness as I'm a first responder and I can't afford to pack on the pounds. With covid it's even harder to work them off. More importantly though, that's not what I want for myself.

I've tried to help in the most supportive, non-judgmental ways that I can but I'm getting nowhere and I want to try everything before I just spit it out exactly as I see it.

She does weight watchers about 1/10th of the time and struggles to stick with it, often falling off the wagon within a couple days. I've told her that weight watchers isn't anywhere near as successful as its portrayed and she's been through it like 20+ times so clearly its not a feasible option for her.

I've given advice on foods to avoid like breads and sugars but she doesn't change her diet. She'll also get defensive if I try and talk to her about her choices in high calorie food.

On top of all that she hasn't worked out since early 2020 and has an aversion to it despite saying that I'll go to the gym with her.

If I were to guess I'd say she's up approximately 100+lbs since we started dating. Being honest I'm finding myself much less attracted to her and the lack of effort isn't helping. I should also note that she wants to lose the weight but doesn't want to change the diet or exercise to get her there.

Has anyone been in this situation that has any advice on how to attack this? I don't want to end things but I'm running out of options here.

Tldr; My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food which she defends and reinforces when challenged on it, its lead to noticeable weight gain over time, I've used up all options I know of to try and help and now I don't know how to approach it.",lat8i8,n/a,2021-02-02 11:08:28

"I've been making food for a girl I like, turns out she's been throwing it all out","**I am NOT OOP, OOP is** u/No-Awareness-8079

**Originally posted to r/self**

**I've been making food for a girl I like, turns out she's been throwing it all out**

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Original Post (wayback machine)](https://web.archive.org/web/20241123190827/https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1gy39kq/ive_been_making_food_for_a_girl_i_like_turns_out/): **November 23, 2024**

I have no where else to talk about this so I'm coming to Reddit. I (21M) am in college, and there's this girl that I'm sort of head-over-heels for. We have a couple classes together and I know some of her friends so we see each other and hang out a lot. I thought there was something between us but I guess I was wrong. I knew she'd been going through a tough time with some family issues lately and I thought she might appreciate not having to worry about cooking while she's worried about all of that, so I've been making her some meals and giving them to her when I see her, usually after class. Food isn't necessarily my love language, I just like to make sure the people I care about are happy and fed.

Well, I was catching up with some of our mutual friends, a couple of whom live with her, and they told me that she either usually throws out the food or gives it to her roommates. I don't think she's eaten anything I've made for her. She always says ""Oh, you didn't have to do that"" all sheepishly when I give her the meals I made, I just figured she was being bashful. I wish she would have just told me to stop so I could've saved some time and energy. I don't know, I'm just upset. I'm not sure where I stand with her now.

Edit: Some context I said in a comment that people said I should add to the original post:

Her friends encouraged it!! I'm very close friends with many people in her close circle and they knew what I was doing, they said it was sweet. I understand now that it was kinda weird and I probably should've stopped. But, I would also say that we're friends rather than acquaintances, we've hung out one on one in the past (which she initiated). I think she just might see me as a friend, which is totally fine, and the message about not just giving people food is 100% heard on my end. I just hated to think that she was stressed and going hungry (she's confided to me in the past that she struggles to make time to eat when under stress).

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** They're being creepy and she doesn't know what's in it. Could be nice quality ingredients, could be blood and semen. Stalkers do weird shit, and op sounds a little stalkerish.

> **OOP:** I mean yeah. As a man sometimes I am not super acutely aware of what a woman might make of a certain situation, and I understand that this thought process is necessary given what women go through. While I had no bad intentions, she couldn't know that for sure. I'll back off. I will say though that her roommates that I'm friends with did encourage it originally, but I realize now it's because they got to eat the food I made.
**Commenter 2:** Just curious; how did you know that she was having family issues and what do you tell her when you give her the food?

It sounds like you interact with her friend group but on an acquaintance base level. How close are you with her and her friends?

> **OOP:** We're friends, I originally knew her through our mutual friends but we hang out one on one sometimes. She told me about what she has going on in her life.

**Commenter 3:** That’s not how it’s done buddy. You ain’t getting love in exchange for food, women aren’t dogs.

> **OOP:** I mean I don't want anything in exchange. This wasn't really an attempt to woo her, I just wanted to make sure she had enough to eat while she was dealing with all this. She's told me and our mutual friends in the past that she struggles to eat when she's stressed. just really care about her and was just trying to help reduce some of her mental load while she's going through a tough time. Regardless of whether or not she likes me, we are friends and I do care about her.

**Commenter 4:** Depends where you're from. There are parts of the world, and the US, where the norm/culture is to give someone a meal if they're struggling with a life event like a death in the family.

> **OOP:** My family is Ukrainian (I was born there) and food is for sure equated to caring over there. I can't count the amount of times I might've told my Baba that I was stressed/tired/upset and I had a plate of food put in front of me as a sort of ""I'm sorry you're dealing with that"". I'm sort of similar where I trend on the skinny side (especially when I'm not doing super well), so I always appreciated being fed.

So, I heard you guys loud and clear that I might've overstepped on this one. Since me and this girl are friends, and I'm super close with a lot of her friends, I figured last night I would text her and apologize. Just because of class and me being at her apartment to see her roommates I'm friends with and whatnot, I know I'll still have to be around her in the future. I made it clear that she didn't even ever have to speak to me again, and that I just wanted to let her know I was so sorry. The conversation went way better than I thought, and it's safe to say we're still on good terms. I figured I'd share this to give everyone closure.

**Transcript of the text messages**

**OOP:** Hey, I just wanted to reach out and let you know I found out you've been getting rid of the food I've been giving you. If what I've been doing made you uncomfortable I just want to apologize, because that was never my intention. I've realized that it was a little much and I should've asked if that was something you were okay with. You don't have to keep hanging out with me, or even respond to this message, I just wanted you to know I'm sorry that I likely crossed a boundary with you. 

**Friend:** hey hey!!! you didn't make me uncomfortable at all:) i just have kind of a funky relationship with food and i struggle eating things that i didn't make myself. honestly i totally owe YOU an apology for not explaining because i understand you went through the effort to do that for me, and me not eating the food but still accepting it might feel like a slap in the face. in my defense the food mostly went to my roommates, the only times i've thrown it out is when no one got to it before it got too old. i think it was really sweet that you were thinking of me like that :) i was worried that telling you to stop would put you off hanging out with me 

**OOP:** Ah, that is so good to hear. So maybe we skip the food and just hang out next time? I'll be back at school Dec. 1st

**Friend:** yes let's do it!!!

Edit: I love how most of Reddit told me to apologize to her and never speak to her again on my last post, and now I'm getting clowned for doing exactly what you guys told me. Pick a struggle lol

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I forgot how much guys just straight up don’t listen to women. We’re not puzzles and many of us speak literally. “You didn’t have to do that” literally meant “you didn’t have to do that.” You were so dialed in on how you feel that you didn’t take hers into account.

> **OOP:** She literally smiled and said ""awww, you didn't have to that"". People say that when they're bashful. If a man said that, we'd all assume he was being polite and bashful. If she wanted me to stop, she should have made it clear. It doesn't matter now because I already posted an update, your comment just rubs me the wrong way.

Just finished reading and I feel like this is going to affect my relationship with food,"I have ARFID, which is an anxiety-based eating disorder that manifests similarly to the kind of picky eating you see in young kids. I have a decent list of safe foods, but getting myself to try new foods is really difficult, and a lot of what I eat is extremely plain.

Seeing Dungeon Meshi get popular on Tumblr, I decided to give it a try, partly because it seemed like something I'd really enjoy, but also because... I mean, it feels a little silly to say, but I thought reading a story about getting adventurous with food might be good for me?

And I'm kinda shocked by this but it like. Kinda worked???? I don't know for sure if I'll be able to follow through, because sometimes I just physically cannot force myself to bite into something that feels unfamiliar or off, but I've started thinking about stuff I might actually be willing try, and I'm really excited about it. Nervous! But excited.

I know this probably seems like such a tiny step, but right now I'm psyching myself up to try adding lettuce to my burgers. Usually I eat them completely plain aside from cheese :') It's a bit embarrassing being 21 years old and afraid of a leaf... I know it's illogical, but that doesn't stop my brain from stressing out about it. Just thinking about trying that change honestly makes me feel like I'm going to cry, but I'm really determined to give it a shot, and I've never felt this much conviction to try something new without being encouraged to by someone else. So! That's pretty big!

I don't have much of a conclusion here, I just wanted to share because 1) I felt like doing so would make it harder for me to chicken out? But also 2) it felt very in the spirit of the manga, I guess. Especially with Izutsumi's whole arc... I could very much relate.

To open the floor to actual discussion here, though... Does anyone else feel like Dungeon Meshi has impacted their relationship with food?

Edit: Thought I'd come back and let you all know... I did it! Sort of! I started thinking too hard about the lettuce and scared myself, but a friend of mine suggested I take a smaller step by adding a vegetable I already know I like. So! I just tried spinach on my burger!!! And I liked it!! :D",1ca396g,n/a,2024-04-22 05:55:59

Rant: (TW: ED discussions)  I want customers to stop making their unhealthy relationship with food my problem,"EDIT: yes, i understand that im going to hear about food while working in food service, but im also allowed to yap and complain on the internet about the way some customers choose to make a big deal about how they want to be mariah carey level skinny legends.

Its officially ""New Years Resolution: Lose weight"" season and 6 days in I'm already at my limit with it. I'm in recovery for an eating disorder, and hearing ""can i get a SKINNYYYYYYY vanilla latte? (which by the way, has 0 meaning! thats not a menu item! what milk do you want! sugar free? less pumps? just tell me what you want)"", ""how many calories is in that?"" ""Ugh, thats sooo much sugar and so unhealthy and gross"", is so... uncomfortable. To clarify, im not talking about people who just ask for nonfat/sugar free, or asking to reduce the amount of pumps, im talking about customers who feel the need to moralize it or make it very clear that theyre restricting their calories. ESPECIALLY if they are actively negatively talking about their body in front of their kids as they place their order. I understand that some people are on a weightloss journey, some people might be diabetic and cant have sugar, that isnt my business. Today i had a customer who decided it was appropriate to lecture me for about 5 minutes about how disgusting she thought the amount of sugar in the peppermint mocha was, and how people just ""dont care about their bodies anymore, and i wouldnt be caught dead drinking that disgusting sh!t"". I! Do! Not! Care! Just order what you want and move on! I don't want to hear about it! The person behind you who is looking forward to their peppermint mocha who now feels embarrassed doesnt want to hear about it! Maybe make your new years resolution to focus on positive aspects of life, not the negative!",1hvd3b5,n/a,2025-01-06 23:22:27
"“Fast metabolism” is a lie, stop making yourself feel bad.","I have a very skinny friend who has claimed to have a “fast metabolism”. She’s always been the type to brag and say “I don’t know how I’m not fat, I eat WHATEVER I want and just don’t gain weight. I don’t even work out either, I spend the whole day on my computer”. Obviously when I was naive, hearing that would make me feel like dog shit and question my own genetics. It made me jealous because I believed it, as everytime we would hang out and go to restaurants, she would order burgers, fries, pizza, everything that isn’t considered low calorie. She would also eat anyone’s leftovers if they didn’t want them. So essentially, she was consuming 2000+ calories every time we would meet up which made it more believable. 

However, I soon learned the truth when I moved in with her for 2 months as a roommate. Yes, she did eat high calorie foods everyday, but I noticed she really only ate 1 meal a day and maybe 2 small snacks usually both below 200 calories in between. And while she did spend a lot of time being sedentary, she was also the type to frequently pace around the house while listening to music or being on a phone call. She’d also walk her dog 1 hour a day which she wouldn’t consider “working out”. So in reality, she really wasn’t eating as much as she claimed she was, and the small habits of pacing around and walking the dog basically kept her at maintenance, hence why she would never gain weight.

Unless they have hyperthyroidism or some other health condition that seriously makes them not gain weight, most people who claim to “eat whatever” and not work out and still can’t manage to gain weight in reality do not eat as much as overweight people would and are ignorant about what “eating a lot” actually means. Or they have certain habits that unknowingly burn calories throughout the day. Most people who are overweight or obese get to that point because our relationships with food is messed up, while theirs is normal. Food isn’t a priority for them, and that’s the biggest difference ",1lr1dw5,n/a,2025-07-03 21:26:43

AITAH for telling my wife to stop making her eating disorder obvious to the kids?,"
My wife Alice has an eating disorder basically her whole life. She doesn’t allow herself anything with too many carbs or sugar in it. Her meals are mostly veg and protein. 

When we first started dating, she was so motivated to change that about herself and develop a healthier relationship with food. She started seeing a therapist and a doctor and was doing really well. She came a really long way and I was doing whatever I could to support her. But when we had our two daughters (8 and 10), she went right back to square one because she was insecure about her body. She completely refused to get any help after because she didn’t want to gain weight. I’ve done everything I could to try help her but she’s completely against it now. 

My daughters and I usually have the same thing for our meals and Alice eats the low carb low fat version of it. Recently, our 10 year old expressed that she wants to start eating what Alice has and she’ll give reasons that sound like exactly what Alice would say. For example, one night we were having rice, salmon and veggies for dinner. My daughter said “dad don’t put rice on my plate, I’ll be bloated tomorrow”. I asked her why she said that and she couldn’t give me an answer. She completely refused to have the rice and I obviously can’t force her, but she’s been doing it more often lately. I sat her down and explained that carbs aren’t bad for her and it’s essential to her growth and health that she has a balanced diet. I thought she understood what I was saying but it hasn’t helped one bit because she still refuses to eat any rice/potatoes/bread or snacks at all.

I told my wife that she needs to stop making comments about her appearance and labelling certain foods as bad because it’s affecting our daughter and I’m scared what level this could get to for such a young child. My wife said “oh sorry, let me just switch my eating disorder off for you darling, didn’t realise it was such an inconvenience”. This ticked me off and I told her to stop being sarcastic and passive aggressive. I said I’m genuinely worried about our daughter and we need to do something to nip it in the bud before it gets worse for her. She said I’m daft for bringing that up with her when she struggles with food too. She said “if I knew how to help someone who struggles with food, I wouldn’t have spent my entire life struggling”. 

My mind is a jumbled mess. I think Im just going to seek help on how to help my daughter and do it on my own but I feel like we won’t make progress if my wife keeps making comments about food in front of her.",18fcyk4,n/a,2023-12-10 20:46:28

This is going to be such a “suffering from successful” post, but bear with me for a second.


I’ve known him for 5 years, different classes and courses but same friend group. Over time, he has genuinely become one of the best people I know, and it’s only getting better everyday. I can’t lie and say he’s not my type; nerdy, charming, sweet, funny, flirty with the right amount of awkward. He comes pick me up from class. Plays hockey without being a douchebag to the skaters. And most importantly, gets treats for my cat. Multiple strangers have mistaken us for a couple, even close people like our friends, professors, and worst of all, my family. He’s kinda perfect, but I’ve never even thought of putting the moves on him, he’s never shown romantic interest in me, we’re friends, nothing more.


Or that’s what I thought.


Today, he was spending the afternoon at my dorm, something he started about a year now. We’re laying on my bed mindlessly watching sonic cartoons when he says (verbatim) “So, baby, where do you wanna go this friday?”


Matter of fact, this is the first time I’ve been called baby by him, so that kinda shocked me. Instead of asking why, I froze and was just like “What’s happening friday?”


He turns to me and KISSES ME (again, first time thing with us), hugs my waist and goes “Our 1 year anniversary, idiot. I’m making reservations.”


At this point, I’m frozen. I genuinely don’t know what to say. I’m gobsmacked. The dude I thought was my best friend, who never even showed interest in the dating thing, is under the idea that we’ve been dating for a whole year. I’m silent while he continues hugging me and scrolling on his phone, racking my brain thinking about what to tell him when his phone starts ringing. It’s his mom, which he puts on speaker and she deadass goes “Hi. Are you still with your girlfriend?” Oh, so now his mom thinks we’re dating too?! He tells her yes, asks why she called. She asks for his help with private stuff I will not divulge here, he turns to me and goes “Sorry, I’ll be back in a bit, sweetheart.”


I just nodded. I was just like “Alright, see you in a bit.” No questions, no screaming, just acceptance. He gets up to put on his sneakers and leans down to kiss me again, which I just accept at this point. It’s a nice kiss besides the fact that my mind is somewhere else. He leaves and I get a text from his coach “Tell (boyfriend’s name) to come tomorrow at 19, he’ll only listen if it’s you” Tf you mean only me?! You’re the responsible adult tasked with training these hockey players, why do you depend on me bringing him to you?! But that led me to a rabbit hole of finding out who knows we’re dating. Apparently, majority of the people I talk to think we’re dating, or if I’m being correct here, KNOW we’re dating, and just, have never mentioned it to me…


I don’t think it’s a prank solely on the fact that his mom called me his girlfriend. They don’t have the closest relationship. She is a very traditional, conservative and religious korean woman. Always serious and does not play around. When she realized early on that her son did not agree with many of her opinions, she stopped caring for him to the fullest, only keeping it civil for the rest of the family and friends. There’s nothing he could’ve done to have her go along with something like this, especially when she wants him to marry young with a nice korean girl, which I’m not. Also, he just does not seem like the guy to play with people like this. He might be dumb and oblivious, but not horrible.


I don’t know what to do now, I mean, he’s a great guy don’t get me wrong, and if the last 5 years are anything to go by, he would be (is?) a great boyfriend, maybe even in the future a husband. But, I’ve never looked at him that way, so I can’t say I love him. When this occurred, it was like the glass shattered and I saw how differently he looked at me, how he talked and acted, stuff that never changed since the beginning but for some reason I’ve never noticed. I can’t sit here and pretend I love him like that, I wasn’t thinking about him in that sense all this time. But, on the other side, I don’t want to hurt him. He clearly thinks we’ve been together for that long so he has to have strong feelings for me, and I don’t want to step on them and scar him like that.


I can’t just keep dating him though, something that I’ve apparently been doing for a year. I could learn to love him eventually, it wouldn’t take much to be honest, but it wouldn’t be fair to him or me. In my defence, who dates someone and just does not ask them about it. If the roles were reverse and a year ago something happened where I was like “shit, I love him, this was probably a date, we’re probably dating right now” I would’ve confirmed with him or at the very least said something for the following year, not only at the 1 year mark.


I just don’t know what to do. I’m scared and angry, disappointed in myself for not recognizing the situation sooner. Feel like I’m stuck between the sword and the wall. Last thing I want is to hurt him, but I also don’t want to lie to him. How should I go on about this with him?


TLDR: My best friend believes we’ve been dating for a year, alongside our friends and families. He’s never ask me, so now I don’t know the best way to approach him about this. Please help.


Update: Before you comment, I’ve sent a text for us to meet up and I somewhat already know what I’m gonna say to him. I’ll try and do an update post after the 48 hours pass.

>I can understand the take it slow from a purely Conservative dating standpoint.

>I can not on the other hand understand why you have no pet names for each other. Is anyone from Korea? How do you guys do stuff over there? Maybe it's a cultural thing and though a year was long enough to move the ""relationship"" along? How does he pinpoint the anniversary? Did any thing Change 1 year ago OP?

Turns out he’s just dumb and sad. Or maybe crazy and psychotic. I did give him way too much benefit of the doubt.


I read a lot of comments and messages that were sent to me privately on what I should do. Big thank you to everyone, majority of you were nice and helpful. Also big sorry for the sweet lady wishing me a happy future marriage, not happening soon. And to the people saying it was fake, if I had created a good love story, I would’ve sold it to Netflix or HBOMax or Wattpad instead of being a loser and asking reddit for fake help.


I brought it up to my psychiatrist, showed her the reddit post I made, a few of the messages I’ve received and she basically had the attitude of “Hey, remember that great guy, well he’s a piece of shit now, so let’s learn about moving on and not reminiscing on a broken friendship” which I think is the best way to go in about this.


Now, tbh I don’t remember much because I wanted to cry from the moment he started talking. Also I was quiet and only spoke very little because I did not want to make a bigger scene than it already was. I just let him talk for a few hours and then dipped. Towards the end, he was shouting and unpredictable, people were looking and I just wanted to go home.


I decided that we should meet up in a public space. Before his practice, I sent him a text and asked if he wanted to meet up at a coffee shop we both know. He called, said yes and “You sound serious, should I be worried?” to which I said “honestly, yes, you should” He told me to stop joking and then went on to his practice. Fast forward a couple hours, I’m sitting there and he comes in, sits in front of me and thanks me for the food I ordered for him. We start eating. I’m a nervous wreck and he realises, which led to him asking “Are you really ok, (My name)? You didn’t seem good a while ago, and from what you said, I’m actually worried now”


So I lay it out on him. I ask him why he thinks we’re dating, why does so everyone else and what led to him thinking that. Now, he’s just quiet and I’m just looking at him not say anything.


Stuff after this is a bit fuzzy because I just wanted to cry. This next shit came very out of the blue for me as well, it´s just fucking weird looking back on it.


He said something like “I didn’t really think we could actually date if I asked you up front” to which I said “that’s how relationships usually work tho, you ask” to which led him on a tangent about women in general. Opinions that he shared with me and said to my eyes with no regret. What I saw in front of me was no longer my best friend of 5 years, it was a boy who grew up to be a man and to have a very damaging idea of women. Stuff that I could assign to immaturity, but he had nicer things to say when he was 14 than what he told me now.


I just interrupted him and asked what led him to think about women this way, since he never let his family, most predominantly his mother (tbh I don’t think even the most conservative women in the world would say what he said, but his mother still has some not so nice beliefs about women) influence him into these antiquated ideas. He was quiet for a while and that did give me some pity, until he opened that mouth of his again “You know, there’s these podcasts.” That let me know everything I needed to. “Oh so you’re a Tate fanboy now?” He starts arguing and yelling that it’s not him but that they know what’s right and wrong, how things should be and to be honest, I’m not really listening to him at this point, I just want to get out of there and cry. I’m listening, but nothing is registering. Some of the milder things he started yelling are about women and our relationship with food and how we should have a limited amount, how we’re so vulnerable and emotional, ready to blame men for everything and how we start yelling at every minute inconvenience (which is funny in hindsight), how menstrual stuff was A HOAX and that I was no doubt lying when I couldn’t walk from my period pains because “I wanted his attention” and that “no girl can possibly feel a greater pain that a man” He also said that when we were talking about his course - something to do with car parts - it was not “cute” and “sweet” of me (let alone women in general) to act dumb and pretend I’m clueless, because that does not make me more appealing (I genuinely don’t fucking know how a car works, my fucking bad)


I tell him that if this is all a big joke, it’s not funny. He interrupts me and talks about how he listens to these men but doesn’t tell anyone cuz he knows I and our friends wouldn’t agree, tells me I’m not a “perfect woman” (whatever that means) but that he would still like to date me but couldn’t tell me because I’d say no and “ruin his fantasy” hmmmm…


Im crying now, and people are noticing, so I just want to get out of there immediately. I tell him (not verbatim, but along the lines) “You’re so fucking stupid, (Name)! You genuinely could’ve dated me, if only you had asked. You could’ve had everything but you started listening to opinions of guys who have nothing. How sad can you be to pull a stunt like this instead of asking like a normal person?” He starts yelling that I’m wrong and they know what is right, starting a whole rant that I don’t have the strength to listen to. I stand up, start walking and he grabs my arm. More people are staring. I tell him to let go and he only does when I threaten to call the police. I left telling him to never speak to me again.


I am now home. I’ve blocked him on everything and told some friends what happened. They were all shocked by how he acted and what he said. One guy did tell me “He was always easy to influence tho”. I asked why they thought we were dating and they told me it was how we acted like a couple (I guess that one is on me) combined with the fact that HE TOLD THEM YES WHEN THEY ASKED and since the behavior checked out, they just never thought to talk about it with me. I’m not responding to any of them right now.


To be honest, I’m moving cities in a few months with my family. I used to cry about it nonstop because I’d have to leave all my friends here, including him and that was the last thing I wanted. Now, I’m kinda glad I don’t have to worry about bumping into him. I just feel distraught, like, that was a nice friendship, it was a pillar of my childhood and now it’s just gone.


He said and did some nasty things, even if it was in the span of a few hours. If up until moving he comes up to me personally or tries to pick me up from class, I’ll repeat that I do not want him in my life anymore. If push comes to shove, I’ll call the police, not that I’d think they’d do anything tho. I’m also sharing my location with both my older brother and father; yes it might be a bit “delusional” and not needed, but you never know.


He was a great guy and we did have a good friendship up until he decided to view women as objects and date one without asking because “he deserves it” I just can’t stop crying. I really thought I knew him, and for him to be able to spew those words and opinions at me like that, stuff he’s always been against from what I remember, it was shocking. It’s only been a few hours but it’s already weird not having that constant text or call happening. I feel like it’s kinda empty but I don’t want someone like that next to me. The worst for me is that I see no change. He has no sisters and his mother does somewhat think that way as well, and so does his father. Maybe coach could help, but idk.


I just feel “betrayed ???”, I guess. It feels stupid to say but it’s true. I mean, I get men like this every single day, every girl does. It goes from professors who know me to drivers who are seeing me for the first time. Comments vary from just telling me I’m pretty to more gruesome stuff, I’m used to it. I just never expected it to be someone so close to me, that I trusted. I don’t know when he started thinking like this but now it has me feeling all gross and dirty. If he thinks like this about me and never said it, I don’t even want to know what he thinks about our mutual trans friend, what his opinions are actually like when he’s always been nice and respectful to her.


It does help me chuckle a bit that some of the things he said were just so textbook misogyny that it seems he learned them on a joker sigma instagram account. That is so stupid it’s kinda hilarious if you omit the part where he said rape is not a real problem.


So, that is that. I thought I had a nice friend by my side, but guess not. Never trust a guy, even if you grew up with him, they’ll disappoint you eventually.


EDIT: You know what, fuck this, some of you guys suck. I thought this was a subreddit to help and give advice and yet im still getting dm´s over this being fake and overall clowning me. Like, im sorry if i write in a weird way, but this shit did happen. Do you guys only believe women when they show up dead in the news? I know it sounds insane, it also did to me. But please mind your words, if you're not gonna say something helpful or nice, don't say anything at all. I'm already having a horrible time with all of this and to have reddit men up my dms saying i lied and discrediting me cuz its not possible he'd do that, shut up, please, im begging you. Should have never posted this here to begin with, might just delete it altogether since apparently men only know how to point and laugh at a woman's experience

AITA for taking the vegetables of my kid's burgers?,"I (39 F) have 3 kids, 6 F, 9 M, and 12 F. My husband (40 M) and I decided a few days ago to take the kids to our local restaurant, as a treat, because we don't do that often. My husband is a bit of a health nut, and is VERY restrictive of the foods my kids eat, which is the main source of our arguments.

On Thursday, we went to the restaurant, and the kids were super excited. The server was asking what the kids wanted, when my 12 year old (We'll call her Emily) said, ""Cheeseburger with bacon"". My husband butted in and said, ""With lettuce and tomato"" Emily's face immediately fell. My husband didn't even notice, and Emily looked super bummed.

After the sever took our orders, my husband turned to Emily, and asked her what's wrong. She said that she didn't want lettuce and tomato on her burger, because she doesn't like them. He sighed and said that that they've been through this a million times, and having vegetables with every meal was super important. Emily looked like she was about to cry. She is neurodivergent and a lot of food taste's and textures really bother her, tomatoes being a large one. My husband doesn't seem to care, which REALLY bothers me.

When the food came, Emily didn't even touch the burger. So when my husband went to the bathroom, I took the lettuce and tomato off the burger, put them on mine, and winked at Emily. She grinned and gladly ate her burger. My husband didn't say anything about it, until that night.

He told me that taking the vegetables off was a violation of his trust, because he was just looking out for our daughter. I told him that it was just one meal, and not having vegetables ONCE wasn't a big deal. He said that those vegetables were very important. I left the room, and have been talking to him as little as possible. So Reddit, AITA for taking the vegetables off my daughters burger? I think I might be TAH because it's just lettuce and tomato, and my kids having vegetables is really important to my husband, but I feel like he was being super controlling, and I NEVER want to see my child upset.

UPDATE:

I went to bed when this post had about 200 comments and 50 something upvotes. Now there is 5.8 thousand upvotes, and 1.8 thousand comment. I have been reading through a ton of them, and my heart is breaking for everyone who is sharing their stories with eating disorders and their relationship with food. I have deiced to discuss with my older two about getting into therapy. I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my dick for a husband. Divorce is a serious contender. I would've considered it sooner, but I always thought that it would be better for the kids if we stayed together. I've now realized that my husband is harming my children in ways that could be life threatening. I'm thinking about taking the kids over to my parent's house for the week, because I don't think I can handle my husband doing this stuff to my babies. Thank you so much for all of your support, and I really appreciate it. I will update later about what I've decided to do.",12nozcp,n/a,2023-04-16 00:44:26
"My boyfriend called me “fucking disgusting” for the way I eat chicken, and I can’t stop thinking about it.","To start. I know I’m being a sensitive bitch. I know he was kidding, but it still bothers me. 

For context, I grew up extremely poor and with not the best parents. This has led to me having a… weird relationship with food. I won’t get into it, but it’s a lot. 

Ever since I can remember, when I eat fried chicken, I eat everything, *except* the bone. Including cartilage, and bone marrow. (It may be fried blood depending who you ask, I don’t know, I’ve never researched it. I just break open chicken bones and eat the inside, lol.) 

He has never given any indication that he minds, and I’ve spoken to him about my sensitivity regarding food. 

A few weeks ago, we were trying to figure out where to eat, sitting on my couch with friends and someone recommended a chicken place nearby and my, slightly drunk, bf said outloud, “ugh, no, [OP] is fucking disgusting when she eats chicken.” And our friends giggled, thinking he was joking. I just went quiet. 

 I tried to talk to him about it, but he just kept brushing me off, and asking if I’m really gonna make a big deal about something he said drunk. 

And honestly, I know it sounds ridiculous, but the more I think about it the more it hurts me, and the more I resent him. As if he doesn’t have gross habits? 

Its honestly just made me notice every single thing he does wrong, or in a way that could even me be seen as wrong, and it makes me want to call him out on it. But I know if I did it would be just to hurt him. I’m angry, and sad, and I think I’m realizing that I have to break up with him.


Editing this in because because I keep seeing the same comments: 1.) I don’t do this in public. He had no reason to be concerned I would do this in front of my friends. 

2.) i chew with my mouth closed. I have table manners. My a difficult relationship with food, I mean that I have trauma regarding my food insecurity as a child, including BED, which I have had under control for around 8 months, but any comments on my eating habits are possible triggers.

3.) I have difficulty letting food go to waste, because I have a deep fear of experiencing that hunger again. Hence bringing home all leftovers, turning my rotisserie bones into broths, and pretty much all my other habits. 

4.) he knows all of this. I am fairly open about my traumas, explaining if he asked, but trying not to bring it up, so I’m not just dumping trauma on him all day. 

5.) I will very briefly explain because I’ve gotten several private messages about it. The reason I was locked in a room without food as a child is because my mother was abusive and child abuse is inherently illogical. Lol. In all honesty I can’t remember for sure, but I think I stole a can of Dr. pepper from her bedroom (we weren’t allowed to have her soda because it was too expensive) ",17nh98q,n/a,2023-11-04 08:33:25
Binge-free for 1 month after 8 years of an eating disorder : tips to improving your relationship with food and your body,"Hi! I’m /u/Shinbatsu, and I’m in recovery for an Eating Disorder. This is the longest in my adult life I’ve ever gone without bingeing – at my worst I was bingeing twice a day, maybe at my best it was about once a week but I was also in denial about how frequent/destructive my binges were for most of my life. I’ve been maintaining my weight loss through recovery following Intuitive Eating, and I’ve completely changed how I think about myself and food. I’ve gone from being terrified over food, thinking about it and my body 24/7, to being able to eat whatever I want without fear. I don’t live to eat OR eat to live, I’m somewhere happily between the two!

Over the past few months I’ve amassed a bunch more knowledge talking with my therapist, other ED sufferers, reading, and journaling. I definitely don’t have all the answers, but I’m starting to figure some things out. (The more I learn, the more I realize is out there that I don’t know!) This post ended up quite long, but I worked a bit on the formatting to make it easily readable. It might take multiple readings to digest it all, but its filled with TONS of good information!

My motto is: If I’m hungry and it tastes good, I eat it! If I don't love it, I don't eat it.

**My goal is to help you be a healthier and happier you.** [Here’s my old post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3c743h/f2453_170_1245_455_lbs_obese_healthy_in_2_years/ ) which has more information on the start of my recovery journey, so if you haven’t read it there’s lots of good info there to get you started! I’ve also included a list of good resources at the bottom of this page. 

Here’s a [progress picture](http://imgur.com/0oog7pk) I compiled from digging through my phone backup. I blew my own mind when I saw the changes.

**A special note from me to you:** I don’t know you, and I don’t know what circumstances have led you here, but I am so glad that I could reach out to you wherever you are. Maybe you are at your lowest point, maybe you feel like you’ve got it all figured out, but either way I wanted to tell you that I believe in you. I believe inside every one of us is a golden version of ourselves, like the story of the [Golden Buddha]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Buddha_%28statue%29). You don’t need to become anyone else to reach your ultimate self, you only need to peel away the layers of muck that have accumulated on top of it. **You cannot reach your golden self with negativity, guilt, and shame, you need to love yourself.** It requires a lot of introspection, unburying demons in your mind that are holding you back, and is not an easy task, but I believe in you. This is your life and you’re the only one who can change it – you’re the only you you’re ever going to get! It doesn’t matter that the world is setting us up for failure; living a healthy lifestyle right now is like being a fish swimming upstream. Even if none of what I am saying makes sense with where you are in your journey, I hope that I can plant a seed in your mind that there is a life that **you can live where you aren’t at war with food and your body – it is possible**. 

I’ve heard it said in various places, so I'm not going to claim ownership, but this is the theme for my post: 

##It’s not what you’re eating that’s the problem, it’s what’s eating you. It's not just the food you eat, it's how you eat it.

# Disordered Eating:

**Disordered eating?** Eating Disorders are comprised of disordered eating behaviors taken to the point where it routinely interferes with your life and daily functioning. Almost all of us who struggle with our weight (whether it be losing or gaining) have some disordered eating behaviors, but that doesn’t mean everyone has an ED!  For example, my ED made me incredibly isolated, anxious, obsessed with food, unable to function properly at my job and was messing with my relationship. 

**Some behaviors may seem harmless** and many individuals who have been on diets have them: obsessively thinking about food and calories, restricting certain foods from your diet, having “good” and “bad” foods, feeling guilty after you’ve eaten bad foods, using the scale as your primary measure of self worth, etc. 

These start damaging our relationship to food, and might lead to **more dangerous behaviors** and thought patterns as well, things like: feeling scared of food, food hoarding, feeling like others are watching you eat, not trusting yourself around food, binge eating, purging after eating (including via exercise), feeling socially isolated because you avoid situations where food is involved, etc. Even if these behaviors haven’t progressed to the point where they cause an ED, noticing where you struggle is the first step towards a healthier relationship with yourself and food.

# Mental Health 

Mental health is THE MOST important thing to reaching and maintaining health and happiness. I can’t stress this enough. Your body and your mind are one. If your mind is miserable, your body will be too. Lasting change can only come from the inside out. 

**Sleep and water:** Getting a proper amount of sleep and consuming water are core to keeping your body and mind functioning properly. For me, I’d rather sacrifice some exercising time to ensure I get proper sleep, because me being underslept means I will be grumpy, miserable, and hangry all day. 

**Introspection/Meditation:** You must be able to connect with yourself and learn from your mistakes. Meditation will help you improve your happiness, relieve stress, can help you sleep better, and make you feel more emotionally stable. I enjoy my meditation through yoga, as well as through the headspace app (both links available at the end) 

**Support System:** Having people who care for you to back you up when times are tough are crucial. Getting rid of people who are bringing you down is also key! Positivity >>> Negativity. My support system is my boyfriend, my close friends (/u/90Days_Lex and /u/kkeller4 !), /r/90DaysGoal, my therapist, and my friends on TwoGrand.  I seriously wouldn’t be here without all of them. 

**Balance:** My therapist gave me a good metaphor for balance in my life - think of yourself as a pendulum. In the natural state you are neutral, and might be nudged through every day events, but eventually you can right yourself back to center. The thing that can throw us off balance the most is ourselves, and it tends to be along the lines of obsession on one end and neglect on the other. I do this with video games all the time, I’ll either be obsessed with it and spending all of my free time on it, then I just stop and never play it again. When you swing too far to one side of the spectrum, like restriction of food, eventually it’ll have to go back the other way, and the harder you swing to one side, the harder you’ll swing the other way. (I’ll talk about the binge eating cycle in the next section) The same thing can happen with overexercising – the harder you push yourself to exercise, the more likely you are to burn yourself out and then end up not wanting to do any activity anymore. Everything in moderation, everything in balance.

# The Diet Mentality – and why you need to ditch it

If you’re anything like me, the word “diet” is pretty unappealing to think about. It’s filled with so many false hopes and promises, and the process itself is so sad; you feel hungry and deprived. Diets make weight loss look easy, but studies have shown diets make you more likely to put the weight back on plus a little extra. Even if you’re not currently on a diet, the fact that our culture pushes the diet mentality onto us makes us perpetually scared of food; this is also damaging our relationship with food and our bodies. 

**Restrict -> Overeat/Binge -> Guilt -> Restrict -> Overeat/Binge -> Guilt…** 

Undereating is a form of temporary starvation. Undereating will eventually cause you to overeat. Why? 
You're creating the perfect storm for overeating/binge eating. You let yourself get ravenously hungry, you restrict, and you have all these forbidden foods making you psychologically primed to devour them. 1. You restrict, maybe this works for weeks/months then you 2. overeat/binge. 3. “I failed, I have no willpower, I can't trust myself, this is why I'm fat..”. So you 1. restrict harder, you don’t trust yourself around food because you feel so out of control. The cycle repeats. **The issue isn’t your willpower; you can’t fight biology**. We’re built to survive periods of famine by seeking out high calorie food and eating a bunch of it, and your body doesn’t understand the difference between self-induced famine and real famine!

**Patterns of the chronic dieter:** worries about deserving food, guilty feelings about food and eating, “good” and “bad” foods, thinks food is the enemy, eats based on food rules, restrict-binge cycle, focuses on calories burned via exercise, feels guilty when missing exercise, judges progress and body based on weight, when failure occurs blames lack of willpower, consistently second-guesses body cues, ignores feelings of hunger. 

**Healthier patterns:** “Am I hungry? Do I want it? Does it taste good?” Focuses on how exercise makes you feel, weight doesn’t matter with progress, trusts self around food, and recognizes body cues for hunger and fullness.

# 10 Steps working towards the goal of a healthy relationship with food and our bodies:

1.**No more diets**: say goodbye to all types of dieting, if my points above haven’t driven home how ineffective they are, look at your own history with diets. Diets don’t work.

2.**Change your lifestyle**: tweak the way you cook, eat more veggies and protein, change your portion sizes, find activities you enjoy, build good habits slowly over time, but DON’T give up what you love! Focus on what you can *add* to your diet, not what you take away.

3.**Identify your issues**: Are you one of the many who have a problem with emotional eating? Do you eat too much when there’s free food around? Or is food just being in proximity to you mean its fair game? Do you demonize “unhealthy” food and then crave it and binge on it later? Figuring out where you’re going wrong is one of the first steps to healing because you’ll be more aware of it. 

-	**Don’t eat your feelings**: Because this is such a big issue for so many people, I wanted to make an extra section for it. Becoming more in tune with your body will help you identify emotional hunger separately from physical hunger. Emotional eating is not just eating when sad, its eating to avoid your feelings, eating when bored, when angry, frustrated, excited, stressed, anxious, for social connection, etc.  For me, emotional hunger is sharp and painful, where physical hunger is much more prolonged in onset. Once you can identify your emotional hunger, you’ll need to remind yourself that food does nothing to solve the problem. You need to ask yourself what’s really bothering you, and try to do something that is productive in helping solve the problem! If it’s not something that can be actively solved, writing down your feelings in a journal can help too. When I notice emotional hunger, I try to refocus myself with a little meditation and remove stressors from my environment. Find different ways to soothe your emotions when you are troubled; **this void cannot ever be filled with food**. 

4.**Eat when hungry, stop when full** – The mantra of intuitive eating! You will need to reacquaint yourself with what your body is actually trying to tell you. **Listening to your body** is really important because no one knows what your body needs better than your body itself – especially not some diet plan! Too many of us become numb to signals of hunger or fullness and only feel extremes – we work through our hunger, or put it off because it’s inconvenient, then eat ravenously later. Stopping when full means **forget about the clean your plate mentality**.  If you love it, eat it, if you don’t, stop eating. A wonderful thing I've found with trying to practice listening to my body more is the signals I can now distinguish. Thirst and dehydration are very sharp and intense compared to hunger. True hunger is slower and can be postponed, though I try not to. Emotional hunger is an even sharper feeling than thirst!

5.**Make peace with food**:  **no more good food or bad food**, no more forbidden foods, period. There’s a weird psychological effect that happens when we can’t have something, it becomes more and more desirable to us! An example for me was pop tarts and hot pockets. I used to eat these things all the time as a kid, then they became idolized to me as an adult as forbidden foods. When I actually made peace with food and tried these foods again, focusing on the tastes and textures, I realized I don’t even like them and they don’t hold any power over me anymore. You need to slow down and focus on the act of eating, the sensual qualities of the food, to figure out if you actually like that food or not! For me it turned out that hot pockets are greasy and unsatisfying, and pop tarts are sugary cardboard. 
There’s two big voices in your head that are going to be important to making peace with food : the “food police” and the nurturer. 

- You need to **dismiss the food police.** The food police is every externally generated thought (from your parents, from your friends, from magazines, from society in general) about food that has gotten ingrained in your psyche as ultimate truths: don’t eat after 8pm, carbs are bad, fats are bad, cake is bad, salad is good, fruit is good, pizza will make you fat, etc. When you break one of the food police’s rules, the voice will yell at you and make you feel guilty. It is a completely negative voice that won’t help you reach your goals. When you notice this voice coming up in your head, challenge it. There are no rules with food that are ultimate truths! 

- The next thing that will help is **embracing the nurturer** . The note I wrote to you at the beginning of this post is the voice of the nurturer, it is the caring loved one who will never give up on you. It’ll help you push through the toughest of times. I didn’t have a strong nurturer voice, but I’ve worked on building it up by imagining it’s the voice of my boyfriend and best friends: what would they say to me when I’m struggling?

6.**Trust yourself**: You need to start rebuilding trust with yourself and food. You won’t become an unstoppable bingeing monster if someone puts you in front of your favorite food, I promise. The thing that makes you binge is the forbidden foods and letting yourself get ravenously hungry – if you can tackle these two issues, you can start to trust yourself around food. It might be really hard and scary at first, but each successful experience builds on the others. For me one of my first instances of this was pouring my cereal without measuring it. I guess I just didn’t trust myself to pour a normal amount of food. However, such a small thing had such a big impact, and now I don’t measure my food anymore and I’m building a strong foundation to trusting myself.

7.**Find Satisfaction** - If you ate 2000 calories tomorrow comprised entirely of broccoli and baked chicken breast, you might be physically full, but something in you would feel lacking – that’s satisfaction. There is a balance we must strive for in healthy, filling foods, while also keeping ourselves satisfied. A big key to this puzzle is to **honor your cravings.** Not only will satisfying your cravings make you physically happy, but it is likely to make your body happy too! You might not understand some weird cravings your body has, but it might be seeking out a specific nutrient or macronutrient. You might be like me and end up chasing your cravings if you don’t honor them, trying to constantly substitute healthier things for what I crave, but then some nights it ends up me eating a little bit of everything in my kitchen AND finally caving into a cookie instead of just satisfying myself with a cookie in the first place! If you honor your cravings you'll likely end up eating less overall. We're taught to beat up on ourselves and not enjoy the forbidden foods. If the food isn't forbidden anymore, you're allowed to eat it whenever you want, you'll find yourself satisfied with a much smaller amount and you won't feel out of control around the food. Feeling pleasure from eating is a good thing. If you're satisfied now, you’ll be happier overall and you'll eat less later.

8.**Honor your body with Exercise:** So many people see it as something they *have* to do instead of something they *want* to do. Exercise was the only way I was able to get back in touch with my body and feel alive, instead of like I was trapped in my body and mind all the time. **You can’t have a healthy relationship with exercise if the only reason you do it is to burn calories.** For me the things that keep me going are: Running makes me feel powerful, strong, relieves stress, helps me sleep better, and like I can put my mind to something and do more than I ever thought was possible. I couldn’t even run in 2014 now I can go 14 miles! Yoga helps me feel in touch with my body in ways that nothing else can. Exercise shouldn’t be such a chore that you feel like you need to reward yourself whenever you do it. Not only are you setting yourself back, it just makes your relationship with exercise and food worse. If you must reward yourself, find something non-food related, like a bath or pedicure! If you’re not happy with the exercise you’ve chosen, try another! Maybe you’ve been **over-exercising** and lost touch with why you enjoyed your activity in the first place. I got dangerously close to letting over-exercising destroy my body; it took my therapist and boyfriend giving me some harsh words for me to finally cut back and reconnect with the part of running that I love. Now I run 4 days a week, and I’ve banished self-destructive, painful runs! 

9.**Honor your body with Nutrition:** Once you’ve dismissed the food police, nutrition will be your ally. Instead of making you feel guilty, you will be able to make informed food decisions for your health. For example: choosing between two types of cheese, one has twice the saturated fat of the other, so you decide to choose the lower saturated fat cheese for your health. Or maybe you’ve decided you’d rather have high fat/low sugar yogurt over low fat/high sugar yogurt because the higher fat helps you stay full longer and doesn’t make your blood sugar spike and crash so hard.

10.**Love yourself.** You can either be your best ally or you're worst enemy. You are the only you you'll ever get and there are no rerolls in life, so don’t take it for granted! **If you only make cosmetic changes in your life you're only going to see cosmetic results that fade as quickly as washing off make up**. Nourish yourself physically and mentally and you'll start to shine from the inside out.

# The Numbers Game: 

Numbers do something weird to my brain, as I’m sure they do to others as well. I think this is because my brain sees the number as black and white, either I hit the number or I fail: weight, calorie counting, macros, TDEE. Some people are able to maintain a healthy relationship with the numbers, but for other people this is near impossible. In order for me to recover, I had to break away from the numbers.

**You deserve happiness, not when you hit some arbitrary weight, you deserve happiness right now.** 

**Goals:** What is your goal? This is /r/loseit so I’m guessing it’s “I want to lose weight” … but why? If your goal is simply to lose weight, what do you do when the weight is lost? I think the reason most people gain weight back once they hit their goal is because they set their goal as the endpoint without thinking what comes after. This also seems why weight loss as a goal is incompatible with ED recovery; if your goal is to lose weight, you can’t just stop losing weight because that’s what motivates you, and then you end up in a dangerous place because you only know how to lose weight to be happy. 

**The journey doesn’t end because the journey is your life**. Maintenance isn’t the endpoint – it’s another journey! Lots of other things will happen along the journey of your life. How will you look 5 years from now? 10? 20? How will you feel when you get wrinkles? When your skin sags? When your hair turns grey? Will your self-worth still weigh so heavily on what the scale says? 

**The scale does not reflect body composition.** My focus on weight loss for weight loss sake made me miserable. I had to become happy from the inside out, and then my body followed. I ditched my worship of the scale in order to start a new relationship with my body and redefine what it means to me to be healthy. Besides, 90-95% of scale changes day-to-day are due to water weight, poop weight, or food weight. 
 
What would I recommend for you? **Create a goal that is not to lose weight for the sake of losing weight / being thin**, because this focus is on the wrong thing. For example, make respecting your body and mind the primary goal! In recovery I learned that there were many better reasons for me to engage in behaviors that help my health and happiness than just weight loss: I want to live a long life, to have more energy, to not feel like a prisoner in my body, to feel comfortable in my own skin, to be happy, to run further and faster. Those motivations carry me through the “so what happens after you’ve lost the weight” phase and they keep me going strong every day! You need to accept that weight loss might not come at a steady pace when its not your goal, but that’s ok. So what if you gain weight? Maybe you gained muscle AND lost fat, wouldn’t that be a great thing? This will help you not feel like you’re at war with your body too. 

**Calorie counting:** It isn’t necessary to reach your goals. It can be helpful, but for some people it isn’t feasible without becoming obsessive. I’d highly recommend the app TwoGrand for those in situations like me – it’s a photo food journal that has a strong social component.  Taking a picture of the food you’re about to eat might not seem like a revelation, but it does some crazy things to your mind: you can’t lie when you post the picture, you reevaluate if you’re really hungry, you think “why am I eating this? What purpose does it serve? And do I really want to post a picture of this?”  It’s the best stepping stone I’ve found on the road to intuitive eating.

# “Every bruise is a lesson” – Arya Stark

**How to deal with failure:** Everyone fails because no one is perfect. Failure doesn’t exist for you to feel bad about it, dwell on it, and get depressed. You can use any instance of failure to learn from it. For example, for me I had a bad binge at a party where there was buffet style desserts and a lot of alcohol. I learned that those environments are extremely hard for me to not binge in, and when possible I should take my food onto a plate and move to another room where there isn’t food present so I don’t stand there and graze while talking. Drinking also makes me even less in touch with my satiety mechanisms, so I try to moderate my alcohol a bit more than just drinking freely. 

**Trials and tribulations make you into the amazing person you are today.** I am who I am because of the struggles I’ve overcome in my life. If I didn’t go through the emotional abuse I did as a child, there’s a large probability I wouldn’t be so kind and compassionate today. 

**Show yourself some compassion:** I really like this quote from a TED talk I watched, “If you talked to other people like you talk to yourself you wouldn’t have any friends.” It’s important to learn from your failures, but don’t ruminate on them for longer than that. Life isn’t black and white. Get rid of perfectionist thinking: **You aren’t perfect or a failure**. This will make you spiral hard and sabotage yourself. 

**Your body deserves at least a basic level of respect** (like you’d give your pet) – to be fed an appropriate amount of nutritious food (not just junk), to be comfortable, to receive a minimal amount of physical activity, and to avoid harassment for never being perfect. What I say by comfortable may not make sense, but imagine you had a dog that was overweight, would you let its fur get matted and not trim its nails because its overweight? Would you not give it belly rubs until it lost weight? You deserve to groom yourself to whatever standard you would normally have for yourself, you deserve comfortable clothes, your body deserves to be treated nicely - get a massage, take a bath, get a manicure for example! **Stop body bashing**, it will make it impossible to respect your body. Every time you think negative thought about your body, try to replace it with a positive statement – focus on a different part of your body that you like, or what the body part you don’t like has done for you instead of just focusing on its aesthetics. 

Here are some common **cognitive distortions** you may have. These played a large role in my anxiety and my eating disorder, and tackling them has been EXTREMELY important: 
	
•	**Polarized Thinking** - black and white, good food or bad food, eating nothing or eating everything, perfectionism or failure. There is no middle ground, but the world doesn’t work like this – everything is a shade of grey. Break this habit and when you notice yourself with thoughts that are repetitive and have the words ""must"", ""always"", ""never"", ""only"" - challenge them and replace them with more accurate thoughts!

•	**Catastrophic thinking** - thinking to the extremes (these are all things I've said in the past): ""this is hopeless"", ""I'll always be a fat failure"", ""my life is ruined because I gained two pounds"", ""If I let myself have one slice of cake I'll eat the whole thing and be a fat whale"", ""my boss is so mad at me I'm definitely going to be fired."" Catastrophic thinking turns a small bad thing into a black hole where you have no hope of climbing out of, you need to notice when you're starting to have catastrophic thoughts and try to replace them with more positive and accurate thoughts. 

•	**Pessimism** - seeing the worst part of every situation, this kind of thinking can suck any happiness out of you because everything seems negative. You condemn your progress and can't notice your successes. For example, maybe I ate badly once this past week, and I tell myself ""I'm awful, I had a terrible week,"" when more accurately and optimistically I should say ""I messed up once this week, but I did so well at many other occasions."" 

•	**Linear thinking** - the goal is the object of our desire, the faster you lose the weight the better, anything else is failure. Whenever things don't progress linearly as you expect, your goal is at stake and you feel awful. Instead try process thinking - focusing on the journey and not the destination. You'll notice the things you've learned along the way and it will help you stay more positive.

My daughters eating disorder is killing me financially.,"My daughter hates food. I think she has arfid but I've been ignored by countless doctors so fuck me, I guess. She had a three day anorexia workshop (which did absolutely nothing).

She's always hungry but won't eat. She's gone weeks. If you give her food she likes she'll eat until it hurts - but the food she likes is so expensive. I'm living on plain rice this week just to afford her food. Literally three times a day. My son hates her because of the food. I've applied for financial assistance so many goddamn times. I work over forty hours a week and after bills I barely have £70. At least fifty goes on feeding her and it never lasts her that long. 

I am so tired. I'm hungry. My son fucking hates his life and he's told me so many times how much he wishes we could just let her starve. 

I'm going to drag them both in to the doctor tomorrow, have them express their feelings, be called a bad mother and go home to a freezing house because we can't afford to eat and have heat.

I fucking hate my life. What did I do to deserve this?",1ajo6lf,n/a,2024-02-05 18:50:20

My eating disorder was a choice.,"I truly don’t understand why most experts on ED’s claim it’s not a choice. I consciously thought about it and chose it. I knew what anorexia was and I literally told myself, “I want to go anorexic for the summer.” I didn’t understand the ramifications or reality, but I chose to not eat for the purpose of losing weight. It wasn’t a diet that got out of control. It wasn’t something I fell into. I chose purposefully to do it. 


I (F20) was 13 when I made this decision. There was something traumatic happening in my life where I was literally physically not in control of my life. And obviously, yes, to cope with that, I restricted. But I didn’t make that connection when it happened. I purely wanted to starve myself to lose weight. Yes, the cause wasn’t my fault. But the way I chose to deal with it, an eating disorder, was a choice. 

This is my long winded way of saying I don’t understand why people say it’s not a choice. I made a choice to “go anorexic.”


EDIT: Thank you for everyone breaking it down. I’m still not exactly sure how I see it, but you’re helping me see it in a different way. I’m taking the phrase a bit too literal, I think. Also thank you to those telling me to be nicer to 13 year old me and being patient",15hlcov,n/a,2023-08-04 00:43:22
Realized I Developed an Eating Disorder - A Word of Warning,"Hello everyone. This isn’t a post meant to discourage anyone losing weight (because you’re doing amazing and I’m so proud of all of you), but is instead a word of warning showing what might happen if you go too hard in your mindset. I’m still in disbelief that I actually have an issue, but certain situations have shed light on the fact that I may have a problem.

I’ve lost a total of about 80 pounds, and my goal weight was (is?) 125 pounds. I’m not quite sure what my exact weight is at this moment, but I’ll guess about 130 pounds, unfortunately. I only say unfortunately because I made it down to ~127 pounds at one point, but recent events have caused me to gain a bit. I usually weigh myself every day (sometimes multiple times a day), but have tried to implement a rule in the past week to only weigh once a week. 

Anyway, I’ll cut to the chase. I lost most of the weight by restricting calories to 1,200 a day and never had a cheat day. I’m surprised I had so much willpower, but I lost 45 pounds in a 6 month time period (the initial 35 came off somewhat slowly a couple years prior to that point). Once I reached around 135 pounds, I began to somewhat maintain and very slowly lose weight. I ate at around 1,500 calories and slowly dropped a few more pounds over the next year. 

About 6-7 months ago, I introduced exercise into my lifestyle. Previously, I HATED exercising. Now I can’t live without it. Starting in January 2019, I began to ramp up the cardio and went every single day for a minimum of 35 minutes (exercise bike). And I’m not just talking about some light cycling here - I do an intensity level of 8-9 at about 18 mph and finish the session dripping in sweat. I started to do some weights here and there, but weightlifting is still something I have yet to fully explore (I really want to get into it though!). During this time, I’ve eaten at sedentary maintenance calories (1,650). A month or two ago, I began to allow myself a bit more on the weekends, jumping up to 1,800-2,000 on those days. However, I felt very indulgent and “fat” doing so.

Unfortunately I’ve had an issue with getting my menstrual cycle (is that TMI? sorry), which apparently may be related to the weight change, calorie restriction, and drastic change in exercise. We aren’t 100% sure yet though. I was eventually referred to an endocrinologist and they found my estrogen levels to be low. I also had a resting heart rate of 41, which freaked me out (that’s not normal, right?). The doctor, after I went over my diet and exercise routine, recommended that I eat more and exercise less for the next 3 months and see if my hormone levels change (and if I get a period). That was about a week ago.

The past week has revealed how much of an issue I have when it comes to controlling what I eat and how much I exercise. I also unfortunately have a problem with binging on cheat days (which don’t happen that often, but when they do, it’s bad). I’ve had a handful of moments since the start of 2019 where I lose all control (this almost always occurs at night on a non-counting day) and eat until I am uncomfortably full and in pain. This is followed by extreme guilt and an unshakeable view that I am overweight and disgusting, despite being a normal BMI. I recently took a trip to Disneyland and had my worst binge ever, which resulted in me throwing up for the first time in over 10 years (if it wasn’t TMI, it definitely is now - sorry). Unfortunately, this past Saturday and Sunday were binge days for me. We’re talking sneak to the fridge at 1am for leftover pizza kinda binge days.

Because of the doctor’s recommendation, I have increased my calorie goal to 1,900-2,000 on days I do the intense cardio, and am going to stick with 1,650 on days I am sedentary. I am also going to take two rest days a week from the gym. I had a “rest day” yesterday, but ended up still walking for about an hour and a half total because I craved the exercise. I made the mistake of weighing myself after the binge weekend and was a total of 4 pounds heavier than I was six days ago. Since then, I’ve been in mental anguish over my weight, and cannot shake the feeling of being fat and stuck. I feel like I can’t just jump back into my extreme routine and get the weight off. I feel like I’m never going to reach my goal. I feel trapped and overweight and helpless.

I am terrified of gaining a significant amount of weight over the next three months, and waver between understanding that it’s okay to eat more when I work out and feeling like a complete pig for doing so. I can’t tell how many calories I’m burning, so I always have felt comfortable “playing it safe” by eating at sedentary maintenance. The weight gain over the past week is definitely going to deter future binges, or at least I hope so. 

Anyway, I guess this is just a story that shows how easy it can be to slip into an unhealthy mindset when it comes to losing weight. The unfortunate thing is I’ve been feeling healthier than I’ve ever been and so proud of my lifestyle, and now that I have to eat more and exercise less I feel lazy and fat. I don’t have an accurate view of what I look like, and my perception of my body would change depending on the number I’d see on the scale that morning (with a pound meaning the difference between feeling skinny or fat). Even typing that out is difficult because I am so convinced underneath it all that I’m right and everyone else is wrong. It’s a very tricky situation, and hard for me to acknowledge. It’s a work in progress.

If anyone else has similar experiences, I would appreciate you sharing them with me if you are comfortable enough. I feel fairly alone in this when it comes to the people I know in real life. 

I don’t know if I’m doing any of this right anymore. I don’t know if I’m eating too much now, or if it’s still too little. I don’t know if I’m cutting out enough exercise, or if it’s safe to increase it a little. I’ve had control for so long and now I feel disgusted with myself and trapped in my situation. I’m not asking for any medical advice or anything like that - I know a medical professional is the one to go to here. I guess I’m just looking for support. Or to feel like I’m not alone, or some kind of freak.

Thanks for listening.

Edit - I feel like it might be helpful to mention that I used to have a very high carb diet, but once I started exercising more I switched over to consuming a diet much heavier in protein/fats. Instead of having a massive carb intake, I now eat at a ratio of 30% carbs, 40% fat, and 30% protein. Some of the foods I eat the most are as follows (I tend to eat a lot of the same thing in my daily routine): nuts (peanuts, almonds, walnuts), deli meat, pepperoni/salami, broccoli, carrots, tuna, beef jerky, oatmeal, greek yogurt, eggs, protein bars... so the worry isn't really how healthily I'm eating.",behbkm,n/a,2019-04-18 04:18:04

Helena's eating disorder is telling us something more sinister,"The intro scene in 2x09 was hard to watch.  
>!When I saw Helena cutting the smallest pieces of her only egg, it reminds me of the huge disgust and desire to gain back control we can see in eating disorders. !<  
>!And then, James ""take them raw"". !<  
It hit me like a car.

We're truly at the beginning of scientific psychology thanks to neurosciences.  
This show had the best way to illustrate complex psychological concepts (severance seems to be the conscious version of dissociation after trauma for instance), and there are many researches about the link between anorexia or eating disorders in general and incest or sexual abuse as a child. (I've put some links below, there are so many studies about that! !)

The worst part ? Sometime the abuse can be an incestuous environment without ""act"". It is called ""moral incest"" or ""emotional incest"".  
Years of putting a child into an adult position, sexual allusions, intimacy violations... (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0222961718301685)

And I think this is what we can see with Helena and James.  
Forcing an adult to work was just the tip of the iceberg. I feel like this season is all about seing the truly evil nature of Lumon (kidnapping, child labor, torture, murders...). And as always, Severance is about showing not telling.

This intro scene once again showed us Helena as the product of years of abuse of so many different forms.

OP Accidentally Trained Her Cat To Be An Eating Disorder Support Pet (July 2021 TrueOffMyChest),"Originally posted by u/moonchild_86 in r/TrueOffMyChest on April 12, '21, updated on July 19, '2.


Trigger Warning: Eating Disorder 


Mood Spoiler: >!Heartwarming & Positive!<


[Original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/mpi934/i_accidentally_trained_my_cat_to_be_an_eating/)
 


I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...


I'm feeling guilty today.


I've had this cat for 3 years now. My Ed got significantly worse about 2 1/2 years ago.


At first, I didn't even realise what she was doing. I had a problem with purging for a long time... She would get between me and the toilet, demanding attention and fuss, while I cried. She would sniff my face and lick it, making it impossible to purge. If I locked her out of the bathroom, she would meow so loudly that I'm sure the neighbors heard.
 

I finally managed to stop purging last year after recovering and relapsing a few times. The lockdowns have been really difficult, and not being able to go to the gym hasn't helped.
 

A couple of months ago, my cat stopped eating. She got so skinny, she was really underweight. Vets couldn't find anything wrong, I hadn't changed her food, there was no reason for it.
 

I'm not sure how it happened... One day, I decided to have breakfast, too. So I sat down with my food and put her bowl next to me. And she finally ATE... I did the same at lunch time. And again, she actually ate.


The same the next day. And the next.


We've been doing it for a while now. She's still underweight, but she's getting there.


I wake up at 7am every day. We have breakfast at 9/9.30. I need those couple of hours to build up to breakfast.


I slept really badly last night. I woke up at 9.10, and I just couldn't do it. Lunch is at 12, I just couldn't eat.


I put Lily's food down by me. She stared at me. Stared at her bowl. Stared at me again. Then walked away.


I'm heartbroken that I couldn't do it for her. She needed me to eat and I let her down...
 

She finally ate at lunchtime. I had a sandwich. She kept glancing at me, pausing for me to continue before she would eat more.

 
People say we don't deserve animals.


I don't deserve this cat. She is saving my life, quite literally, and I don't think anyone appreciates or understands how incredible that is.


It's also absolutely terrifying. I don't deserve this cat...

AITA for triggering a girl’s eating disorder by ordering a salad?,"Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up but wow. Thankyou for all the love and support guys. I truly appreciate the people who gave me legal advice on the issue and how to deal with it without any repercussions and the all kind people who took their time to learn about my culture and also the kind people who stood up for me against trolls who invalidated my feelings and dietary concerns. Thankyou for all the awards btw.



I am part timing in an IT company that is very close knit. My boss Steven and his wife were always sweet. 

It was my first month and it was my boss’s “birthday week” so he and wife Melissa were kind enough to include me in this fancy dinner they were taking everyone to. A week prior to the dinner, Melissa added everyone to a group chat and asked whether we had any suggestions on where to eat. I told her that I am fine with anything as long there are vegetarian options available or at least chicken.

They brought their daughter Stef(15) to the dinner and she is a sweet little girl. Now Stef was really interested in me and she kept on asking me questions about how I look the way I look. Now I am short(5ft) but can be somewhat deemed as “fit” to today’s generation. 

I was transparent with her and told her that I don’t restrict myself to certain foods but rather eat everything in moderation. Plus I have a plant-based diet and home cooked meals so that helps and I also lift weights. Now Melissa overheard our conversation partially. She pulled me aside and told me that Stef was recovering from eating disorder so she encouraged me to be honest with her and not lie to her and not to order anything that screams “diet!”

When I saw the menu, there were little to no vegetarian options available. It didn’t have anything for me. I was very disappointed and made a comment that oh wow there are no vegetarian options. Melissa chimed in and said that eating meat once in a while won’t affect my weight. Now, when I say plant-based diet it’s not that I don’t eat meat but I only eat chicken maybe once a week as a side dish and certain types of fish occasionally but other than that I mostly eat vegetarian dishes. My food habits are not for my “weight” but for my religion/culture. It has nothing to do with my weight. 

When the waiter came in, I was still glued to my menu when all the others had already ordered. Melissa said that oh she will have the duck too and I interrupted and said that no I will have the garden salad(I hate salads but there were no other veg options). 
Melissa got quiet.

After a few mins she told me that I shouldn’t have lied and lead on her daughter if I was going to order a “skinny” salad and starve myself. She said that I am just like those IG influencers who lie to impressionable young girls about their food habits and bodies and I just proved that by ordering a salad after giving her daughter a “don’t restrict yourself” speech and I probably triggered her eating disorder.

I tried to explain that I only ordered a salad cuz there was no other option in the menu for me but then she said that I should have just sucked up and eaten the damn duck as it isn’t going to affect my weight but then again I corrected that it is a religious thing and not a diet thing. She said that if I eat chicken then obviously I would eat other animals too and I was just putting up an act. It was horrible. She completely tore me down and I immediately left",mzletc,n/a,2021-04-27 10:27:57
AITA for having flavored sparking water at my teenage daughter's birthday party? Another mom accused me of trying to give her daughter an eating disorder.," My daughter birthday party was on Saturday morning; she is 13 years old. We just hosted it in our backyard. For food we ordered pizzas, wings, garlic bread, tortilla chips, guacomole, salsa, pasta salad and burgers. When it came to drinks, We had water, sparkling water, lemonade.

So we have the birthday party everything is going well. One of the moms call her Lacy comes to pick up her daughter. She then finds her drinking a La Crouix. She tells her daughter to toss the drink, and then she comes up to me and is like why are you offering diet products to my children.

I’m like it’s just sparkling water, she then flips out saying that her daughter does not need artificial soda replacements. She goes onto say if I want to give my children eating disorders I can do that but not for her children. 

I was taken a back and just how aggressive she was, and I didn’t feel like I did anything wrong. I was like look I have pizza, wings, brownies this is not a diet party at all. She then tells me I have no right to judge what is a diet product or not. She and her daughter both left. Also she later posted on Facebook (I am not friends wit her) that 'some people are trying to push diet products onto children that aren't even theirs.'

FWIW if my children want soda I am cool with them having it in moderation, but none of my children do. And it was just really odd for me too, like I have never heard of anyone say that flavored sparkling water is an artificial replacement for soda?? Also I didn't say anything to her but it was extra odd because both her and her daughter were obese, so its just extra odd they are accusing me of trying to give them eating disorders?",nhxtam,n/a,2021-05-21 17:18:21
Emily is exploiting her child’s eating disorder for job security & it’s disgusting.,"Title pretty much says it all. Starting the season off with that and then the People article following directly after, she is awful. She can scream from the rooftops about how Katie is hurting her family by talking to “bloggers” but that is nothing compared to this. That kid is not nearly old enough to consent to this being shown, and not only will he be bullied for this at school, it will FOLLOW him in his future. It will be the first thing that comes up when you google his name. Shame on her AND SHANE for thinking this is appropriate for public consumption. & I didn’t think I could possibly dislike her less than I already did. ",1m06a8z,n/a,2025-07-15 02:40:06
TIFU by accusing my son of having an eating disorder.,"So, I like to think i'm an O.K mom. I don't smother my son or let him get too crazy. He's fifteen so I always knock on the door, not just to be respectful, but because there's some things a mom shouldn't see.

Well, yesterday he left to go to the McDonald's across the street with some friends. I assumed he'd be a couple hours so as far as I knew I was alone. I decided to take advantage by putting on some headphones that wouldn't be inevitably tugged on with a ""Mom, can-"" question following.

I'm doing the dishes, sweeping, trash, etc while Metallica is blasting in my ears. I start gathering laundry/putting it away, and unbeknownst to me my son got home earlier than expected.

I decided to toss his gym clothes I just finished washing on his bed while I was putting away my own clothes as our rooms are right next to each other. I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS HOME. I walk straight in without knocking and I'm horrified.

My 15 y/o son is...shoving a spoon down his throat and gagging over a cereal bowl. What the fuck.

He instantly jumps, slowly turns over to me, and the spoon almost comically drops from his mouth. I set the clothes down and in my confusion/horror sit down next to him.

I asked ""What were you doing?"" and he's extremely nervous and keeps repeating ""it's nothing i wasn't doing anything.""

He's on the wrestling team and it clicked in my head *oh shit he was making himself throw up he must be body conscious how did i not notice he was doing this to himself*. 

I start giving a mom speech about how body dysphoria is extremely common in teens and he shouldn't be afraid to ask for help from a trusted adult, that i'm here for him, he's perfect just the way he is. 

He looks like a deer caught in the headlights and remains adamant he wasn't doing anything. I asked ""Is this something you'd rather talk about with (uncle) or (coach)?"" He's exasperated and tense saying there's nothing to talk about.

Finally I just have to say ""It's pretty obvious what you were doing and I need you to be honest with me or someone else so we can figure this out.""

Him: ""I wasn't trying to throw up!""

Me: ""Then what were you doing?""

Him: ""I needed to know if I have a gag reflex!""

I'm extremely confused at this point and ask why. He blurts, ""I'm gay!"" I'm completely shocked and he has tears in his eyes.

It clicks.

I immediately wish I hadn't done laundry that day and give a quick ""I'm sorry, it's okay, I support you completely, I'll just...leave you to that"" and continue doing chores.

Dinner rolls around and he's refusing to make eye contact but eventually we ease into a conversation about how he's been hiding it for awhile, has a lot of homophobic friends and was ashamed to tell me because ""I'm your only son so you wouldn't have grandkids"". He planned to come out in college. I had no idea he thought I'd react that way and assured him I'd love him no matter what.

Apparently he's also not planning on...doing anything he'd need to practice with a spoon for in the near future...but was just curious and wanted to be ready. I'm relieved but mostly want to forget I ever saw that. At least it brought us closer.


TL;DR walked in on son gagging himself with a spoon. thought it was bulimia. turns out hes just gay.",cyneur,n/a,2019-09-02 10:45:26
"7 months pregnant, OB tells me I've gained too much weight. (Tw: eating disorders)","        Last week I had one of my regular ob checkups where they listen to your baby's heartbeat and ask you how you feel and if you have questions and all that. I told her I been doing great, no real issues. 
        She says my blood pressure looks great and then starts to kinda chuckle and says it's recommended that women in my bmi range should only gain 20-25 lbs and I have ""definitely reached that goal haha"". For reference when I wasn't pregnant I was 150-155lbs. 
        I told her I havent really changed my eating habits and I don't get weird cravings or anything. She told me ""I know being pregnant you can just smell food and gain weight but maybe instead of reaching for cakes and cookies you should reach for fruits and vegetables"". 
        At this point I'm starting to tear up a bit and I'm like.. trying to make my voice sound normal like there's isn't a lump in my throat. I forget what exactly I said next but it was something about how ive been going to the gym. She responds ""well it's not like the baby is 25lbs"". 
         I couldn't believe a medical professional would say this? Like ya a baby isn't 25lbs but what about hormonal weight gain? Amniotic fluid? The excess blood you get when you're pregnant? 
        This doctor is new to me because I had to move states (military), I had all my medical records sent over and I've done multiple screenings for everything since I arrived here. I made sure to let them know that I'm recovering (badly) from anorexia. I struggle so badly with body image issues. I cry on and off about being fat most days (even before this visit) and this doctor visit just crushed any confidence I had. 
        I dont eat cakes. I don't eat cookies. I snack on raw carrots, I choose sugar free, fat free, low fat, low carb, every diet food buzz phrase at the grocery store. I spend hours in the gym, I go on long hikes. When I was 90lbs I was too thin, I was just right at skinny fat 120, too big at 150, and too big when I'm growing a whole ass human inside me.

        Sorry if there's confusing wording, I got more upset as I wrote more. Don't really have any place to rant, my husband's gone 1/3rd of the time.



Edit: you guys got me sobbing. Your kind words are the warm hug I never knew I needed about this. Thank you for helping me feel less alone

I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"I'm feeling guilty today. 

I've had this cat for 3 years now. My Ed got significantly worse about 2 1/2 years ago. 

At first, I didn't even realise what she was doing. I had a problem with purging for a long time... She would get between me and the toilet, demanding attention and fuss, while I cried. She would sniff my face and lick it, making it impossible to purge. If I locked her out of the bathroom, she would meow so loudly that I'm sure the neighbors heard.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"I know it sounds bad when summed up that way, but I couldn’t think of a better/more descriptive title, so please hear me out before judging.

My (25F) sister Julia (28F) was overweight growing up while the rest of us (five girls, no brothers) were always petite. No one in our family ever treated her badly for her weight, though my mom did try to help her diet several times throughout our childhood for purely health reasons. She was hospitalized for her eating disorder for the first time when she was 18, and she’s been in and out of treatment facilities since then. She’s been “recovered” several times over the years, but it’s never been permanent. 

Pre-pandemic, Julia seemed to be on a recovery kick again. She looked healthy, seemed to be eating normally, and even asked if I wanted some of her old smaller clothes she was giving away (she has some nice stuff from when she was thinner—as I mentioned the rest of us are pretty petite). I was hopeful she could keep it together and felt okay about asking her to be a bridesmaid at that point.

That was the last time I saw her though (Feb. 2020), until I saw her Friday for Christmas. Julia has gained a LOT of weight in that time, probably 20 pounds, which is a lot because she’s short. This is a huge red flag to me because prior relapses have been preceded by weight gain, which seems to trigger another relapse.

So the way I see it, there are two possibilities from here. The first is that she relapses and loses all the weight, in which case she might not even show up for the wedding (she’s missed big family events because of being in residential treatment before), or maybe even worse she’ll continue to gain weight, in which case things like dress fittings could be a nightmare for her body image. In either scenario, I think it makes more sense for her to not be a bridesmaid. That way she can wear whatever she wants, be skinny or fat, show up or not, and it won’t affect the day as a whole.

So I texted her after Christmas to be ask if she was doing okay. Sure enough, she admitted she’d been having body image issues since gaining weight during lockdown. I kindly asked her to step down from being a bridesmaid, explaining that it was for her own good and I was only doing this because I cared about her. She seemed upset but agreed to step down.

Well, now our dad is furious with me, saying Julia is heartbroken. She of course hasn’t brought ANYTHING up to me directly (that’s how she always is). My mom and sisters are all on my side here and agree Julia not being a bridesmaid is what’s best for everyone. Julia has always been my dad’s favorite, so I wasn’t that worried about being in the wrong here—until my FIANCÉ said I was wrong and basically called me an AH for even bringing up her weight with her. Julia for her part now refuses to even engage the conversation and is upset with my dad of all people for talking to me about her “private” feelings. So I figured I’d ask here. AITA?

Edit: okay, I get it, I’m the asshole. And yes, of course protecting my wedding day is part of my consideration here. God forbid one single day doesn’t revolve around her I guess. And to those of you implying that my family caused her eating disorder, honestly screw you. This has negatively affected all of us in a ton of different ways. We never would have wanted this life for her or for any of us.

Edit #2: my fiancé was the one who suggested I post here in the first place to get an objective opinion, so he is reading these comments too. Please stop talking about our future children or saying he should leave me, because frankly you have no idea what you’re talking about; none of you know my life or my history. I‘ve had mental health struggles too—I’m lucky that they don’t involve body image because I have always been thin but they’ve still been immensely difficult to get through. I have BPD and anxiety through the roof. I didn’t have some perfect childhood where me and my sisters all ganged up on our one sister for being fat or whatever story some of you seem to have in your head. I will talk to Julia and try to be more understanding of her point of view, but none of you had to be there when even the mention of her having an issue with food caused a meltdown or when she’s ruined holidays because something as simple as someone gifting her an item of clothing caused her to break down in front of everyone.",kl5el7,n/a,2020-12-27 15:26:19

[my office does fat friday and i have an eating disorder](https://www.askamanager.org/2018/10/my-office-does-fat-friday-and-i-have-an-eating-disorder.html) (October 10th 2018)

Three months ago I started a new job and I really love it. My team is great, the people are lovely, and the work is exciting.

However, I’m struggling with a tradition known as Fat Friday. When I started it seemed to be once a month or so, but now it is every Friday — we’re all told to bring food in to share (and it is frowned on not to). There are themes, such as pastry week, meat feast, etc. The food is all laid out in the office, in the room we work in, and I’m not exaggerating when I say it is a staggering amount of food. It could feed us all twice over. And it is always high fat, high sugar.

Now, I completely understand that people love food and people bond over sharing food. But I am in recovery from an eating disorder that has followed me my whole adult life. I have very little willpower around food and I am terrified of gaining weight. I’ve had panic attacks in supermarkets because of it. The best way I can describe it is that I have an overwhelming, uncontrollable urge to eat, but I also fear gaining weight more than anything. I’ve had lots of therapy and I’m on medication that’s working well.

But Fat Friday is a minefield, with people pushing food on me and encouraging me to eat more. Last Friday, I ended up eating a lot and hating myself afterwards. Today, when I found out FF is now weekly, I almost cried in the office.

I would never want to take away other people’s fun. But am I just powerless here? Would it come across as fussy or overdramatic if I asked to work from home, or to sit in a different room? In my experience people don’t understand how severe my compulsion to binge eat is, and I’d hate to color my new manager’s opinion of me. But the thought of sitting for nine hours every Friday trying desperately not to eat is really worrying me.

[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/12/update-my-office-does-fat-friday-and-i-have-an-eating-disorder.html) (December 6th 2019)

I have to say that your advice was very helpful and it was also so reassuring to see people’s reaction to the idea of “Fat Friday.” I felt reassured that it wasn’t just me overreacting. Most of all, everyone was so supportive and thoughtful, thank you to all of you.

Following your response, I decided to talk to a senior member of my team, who was not my direct manager but did act as a sort of mentor figure to me. I confided that I found Fat Fridays difficult and distracting because I was in recovery from an eating disorder and she immediately agreed with me that the situation wasn’t ideal. She said she hated the constant smell of food lingering. We talked it through and she very kindly asked the Fat Friday organisers to make sure food was only put out in the kitchen, away from people’s desks – without mentioning my name. It helps that around the same time I started a new anti-depressant medication that really helps manage my anxiety and obsessive thoughts.

However, ultimately I did end up telling more people about my history with eating disorders after a colleague in a different department tried to sell me diet products! Think dodgy pyramid-scheme diet shakes that probably make you very ill. In the past, this kind of incident would have sent me into a real spiral and could have triggered a relapse, but I actually ended up laughing about it with my work friends and realising how far I’d come in my personal recovery. Sometimes it really is better to be open, rather than suffer in silence!

Thank you again for all your help and advice. It gave me the confidence to speak up.

AITA for having an eating disorder and not catering to everyone else's discomfort over it?,"I manage my illness the best I can, with the tools my many therapists have given me. So fyi, you can skip the ""you need to see a therapist"" comments, because I do. Seeing a therapist doesn't mean I'm automatically cured, ya know?

Anyway, about three weeks ago, me and my friends were at a park hanging out together catching up. Most of them were picnicking and sharing wine and all that jazz. I had one small glass of wine and prepackaged my food for the outing, as I literally always have done. (It was a chickpea, avocado, cilantro salad wrap)

Afterwards on the way home, people wanted to stop for ice cream. I stood to the side and let them do their thing, and just got a black coffee to enjoy while they ate. This caused more issues, where the same people were telling me to relax and just enjoy myself.

Then we came up to the subject of what our plans for the rest of the weekend were. I said I would be running and then catching up on some cleaning, and then meal prepping. One of them asked me if I ever just say ""fuck it"" and get a frozen pizza. I laughed and said nah, not my thing, but I was making some BBQ chicken & cauliflower rice with roasted brussels sprouts.

She was like BOOOORING and I finally got tired of the comments and said, ""Yeah, it might be boring, but I'm not willing to risk relapsing.""

She got really quiet and then as everyone was leaving, she was like, ""Hey, that was uncalled for. I was joking and you had to turn it into some big stupid thing about your eating disorder. Not cool. That stuff can be triggering for some people.""

I told her I didn't care if it wasn't ""cool"" but that I also wasn't going to take being needled at and prickled at all day because she's insecure, and that she spends her time bragging about binge eating pizza and laying in bed watching TV all weekend and *that* shit is triggering for *me* but I've never said shit about it.

She told me it wasn't the same, and that I was ""making her anxious"" and I said ""Hey, guess what, your comments about my food made me anxious as well. Except the difference is that I never comment on what you're eating, but you're always running your mouth about what I'm eating. Or not eating."" She fought back that it wasn't the same and that I was being a bitch, that I should know how my eating disorder might make others uncomfortable and I shouldn't rub it in everyone's face and just ""calm down and eat a fucking ice cream cone one in a while""

To which I told her, ""So you want me to eat one of my trigger foods just so *you* don't feel bad? You want me to end up with my face down a toilet throwing up everything I eat for the next two weeks just because you feel insecure?""

She told everyone that I made her feel bad about her weight (SHE'S! NOT! EVEN! FAT! She's SKINNIER THAN I AM, like not even a body dysmorphia thing she is literally 115lbs to my 130 and I'm shorter than she is!)

Anyway this is such stupid drama but I feel like she's being fucking ridiculous.

**ETA:** Jeez, I'm overwhelmed by the comments and for some reason, Reddit isn't letting me see them (it keeps redirecting me). Thanks, everyone. I am going to try to talk to my other friends about the situation and see if maybe we need to take some time apart. I hope not, but if that's what it takes, that's what it takes.

My mom came over to see what I was watching and she said “Wow they’re pretty” and I said “Yep” and she made a comment that one of the members is kind of fat and therefore she looks the least nice dancing (and the least nice overall). Then she pointed at another member and said “Look she’s so thin, looks so much nicer” 

I was annoyed and told her that it’s because she makes these kind comments that I became anorexic when I was younger. My mom said I was overreacting and that she was upset that I would say such things about her. 

I’ve been feeling very bad because she cried after I told her she caused my anorexia. AITA?",k9sqo3,n/a,2020-12-09 14:26:27
I haven't thrown up from my eating disorder in a year!,"EDIT- to all the negative comments, I'm happy that I made this post. I'm further enough along in my recovery that they don't hurt me. To others that are still struggling, don't read the bottom comments. They are full of shit and are terrible people. 

I'm lying in bed and the thought just occurred to me. I've thrown up off and on (relapsing about every 3-4 months) for about 5 years. I still struggle sometimes with eating normally but I'm so happy that I haven't binged or thrown up in so long! ",5jx28u,n/a,2016-12-23 13:21:54
Drama in r/ArianaGrandeSnark after moderators ban discussion of Ariana’s “alleged” eating disorder,"r/ArianaGrandeSnark is a subreddit dedicated to criticizing or “snarking” on the singer/actress. Recent photos and videos of Ariana looking alarmingly thin have sparked much discussion about the singers’ health concerns, toxic beauty standards and normalization of eating disorders in Hollywood. 

Last night, the moderators made an announcement that they would no longer allow commentary on Ariana’s alleged’ eating disorder; adding this to the banned topics list, including speculation of drug use, pregnancy and abuse (namely by Dan Schneider, who Ariana worked with on “Victorious” as a teenager. Multiple actors and creative staff have claimed Schneider was abusive and fostered a toxic work environment in the “Quiet on Set” documentary). Users of the subreddit were not happy citing censorship of -in their opinion- an important discussion.

——

>hey everyone,
we just wanted to let you all know that moving forward, we will not be allowing any discussion or speculation about ariana’s alleged eating disorder or mental health conditions. this includes any comments or posts related to her body, mental and physical health, or eating habits.
here's why:
>1. respect for health privacy: while she is a public figure, ariana deserves the same level of privacy and respect regarding her health as anyone else. talking about her personal health in this way is invasive and unnecessary.
>2. toxicity: discussions like these often turn toxic, leading to excessive negativity and hate that doesn’t belong here.
>3. unverified info: there's no solid or credible confirmation regarding these claims. spreading rumors or assumptions doesn’t help anyone, especially our users who struggle with eating disorder and mental illness themselves. at the end of the day, we are not her doctors.
> we’d like to reiterate that we absolutely understand the genuine and good-faith concerns for ariana’s health. we hear you completely.
we want to keep the focus on snarking about her behavior and actions, not her body. there's plenty to discuss when it comes to her public persona without crossing into harmful territory. the mod team has seen and removed a large amount of outright horrible comments and while the comments are not directed us, they are starting to wear some of us down.

>with that, we would also like our users to avoid speculating on and diagnosing mental illnesses. this includes posts such as “i have BPD/NPD/etc and see myself in ariana”.
we kindly ask that you avoid bringing these up in any form. exceptions may be made in the instance of publications or large-scale media articles (for example, the recent new york post front page) addressing ariana’s weight loss. outside of those highlighted posts, comments and posts about these topics will be removed. continued violations or intentionally trying to cheat around the filters put in place may result in a ban.

>while this may not be the most popular decision within our members, please know the mod team has spent months deliberating on how to handle this topic without crossing into the territory of censorship; we completely acknowledge many of you are here as a result of heavy censorship on fan subs. ultimately, we decided that this would be the best decision for our community and users as a whole. we truly thank you all for your understanding❤️
if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the mod team. — the mod team

>I understand that we should respect their health privacy, but Ariana herself opened this up for public discussion when she made that video saying this is ""the healthiest she's ever been"" when she obviously looks unwell. She has a lot of impressionable young fans who look up to her, and some of them literally don't see a difference between her appearance now compared to a few years ago. They need to know that this physique is not normal, not healthy, and not something to aspire to be. In this age of Ozempic, with Hollywood celebrities and social media influencers losing weight and normalizing being underweight, we should have a space to call them out and be a voice of reason

This debacle prompted a user to create their own “second sub”, r/snarkingonariana which amassed nearly 500 members overnight. Users of the main sub also began questioning if the mod team had be “infiltrated” by fans, paid off by Ariana’s team or sent a cease and desist; this was refuted by a moderator’s new-deleted account.

Definitely a polarizing topic on the sub. What are your thoughts?",1iyxhcm,n/a,2025-02-26 20:32:37
"If you have a history with eating disorders, know this about ""I'm Glad My Mom Died""","Jennette (the author) writes heavily and graphically about her eating disorder history. She has struggled with all three of anorexia, binge eating, and bulimia, and she details her experience (including how she felt when doing it). Her book is great to spread awareness on what those with eating disorders go through, especially those who binge and purge, as she even writes about the toll it takes on her body. About her anorexia, she includes details about calorie intake and things like that. But of course, as with most good things, there are cons to it too. Although, if informed, a person who might get triggered could avoid the situation by not reading it. Someone actually wrote a post on r/bulimia to warn people that he relapsed from reading it. Another person commented that they too relapsed for the same reason. If the two of them did, I'm sure many many people around the world have. I don't know if the book has a trigger warning on it, but the audible version doesn't, and it really should.

Anyway, thought you should make an informed decision.

If you don't struggle with eating disorders and choose to read it, enjoy it! It's a great book, and really interesting to see her incredible transformation from Little Hurting Jennette into Adult Healthy Jennette.

Edit: I'm adding a paragraph, unedited, from a response I commented to someone below. I just felt like adding it because I feel it's appropriate to. (That last sentence sounded repetitive, but it's kind of not really lol.) Anyway, here it is, paragraph written by me:

>Yes, it's quite heartbreaking. My heart goes out to Little Jennette. I was going to add that into my last paragraph, but I was struggling with articulating it, and I know that saying that it's a great book is a compliment that an author would appreciate even if it's about their difficult life, so I decided to leave it at that.

Edit 2: How do you create a double line break between paragraphs on the app? I tried looking online, but I can't find a proper answer that's working for me.

Edit 3: Lol I just realized the first edit was actually unnecessary. I had forgotten that I actually didn't just leave it at ""it's a great book"" in the end in the first draft. But it doesn't hurt to leave the edit in, so...there it is. :)

Edit 4: Corrected the spelling of her name.

Edit 5: Oh my gosh upvotes in the THOUSANDS??? 🤯 Wow I had no clue this post would blow up! It's funny how the posts that blow up are always the ones we least expect to. Anyway, thank you everyone for your upvotes :) and your comments!

Edit 6: A big shout-out to u/hamwichsamwich for inspiring this post! I wouldn't have warned you all had it not been for his vulnerable post about his relapse in r/bulimia.",yls59n,n/a,2022-11-04 07:51:12
I think I am developing an eating disorder Update to: I checked my husband's reddit account and regretted it,"I don't really know how to start talking about this so please bare with me. I am currently a US Women's size 18. I have always been on the bigger side but never felt too insecure about it. Yes, I would have moments of insecurity but I wouldn't let it constantly live in my mind. Overall I tried to be body neutral. 

When my husband and I first started dating, he knew this was my biggest insecurity. I recently found out he fat shamed me on reddit (I posted that here before but then deleted it) The term blimp size was used. 

""Blimp sized"" keeps popping in my head. Whenever I look in the mirror or see my thighs expand when I sit down, it echos in my brain. I get uncomfortable enough that I needed a blanket over my legs when I am on the couch. I'm constantly inspecting my legs.I know I am big but I am 13 lbs lighter now than when we got married. 

Years ago, I used to do a 18:6  fast so I thought I would try it again. But now I am also watching my portions more. Before I was eating between 1200-1500 calories sa day. Now I am barely eating. I only eat inside of my time window. Logically, I know my body needs fuel and I should eat more. But I don't want to. I have no interest in food anymore and I used to love to cook. 

I haven't eaten anything all day and my feeding window just closed. Yes, my stomach rumbles sometimes. Now I am liking the feeling of my stomach being empty. I'm craving it. That scares me. But I don't know if I am being dramatic or not. My younger sister had an eating disorder and I know how bad that can get (she was hospitalized). 

I don't know what I am saying anymore. Am I being dramatic? ",1m9gtac,n/a,2025-07-26 01:27:39
AITA for eating a lot in front of my coworkers who are dieting? (Warning eating disorder discussion),"

I work in an office where most people eat at their desks because we're too busy to take long breaks. It's actually encouraged to eat meals at your desk

I struggled with disordered eating throughout a lot of my life and really the best way for me to keep healthy and not relapse is a couple rules for myself

1. Eat when I'm hungry instead of waiting for set meal times, to get in the habit of respecting my body's hunger cues
2. Eat what I want, no restrictive diets
3. Stop eating when I'm feeling my body's natural cues that I'm full
4. Don't talk about dieting or body sizes or shapes

It's honestly made me way healthier, I'm back closer to a healthy weight and getting used to understanding how to be in tune with what my body needs to be healthy and strong and nourished.

I also joke that I eat like a hobbit; Breakfast, Second Breakfast, Elevenses, Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner, Supper, Dessert... Turns out my body naturally gets hungry more often than 3 meals a day.

I work in an open office with coworkers who are on diets. I honestly try to tune out their diet talk because it's really reminiscent of some of my disordered habits. 

But I also eat frequently, And a couple of my coworkers started out by making comments about my ""young metabolism"" and how I eat constantly and am so skinny. I said I don't really like talking about weight or food with people so I'd rather if they didn't comment on my weight anymore 

But they kept making comments about how I'm ""eating again"" or how I stay so skinny. It's kinda hard to hear, because I'm trying to put on weight and me being as skinny as I am right now is still kinda dangerous for my health and isn't enviable

After a while I stopped feeling so patient, and just kept saying ""please stop talking about my weight"" or ""I don't want to talk about diets"" whenever they'd mention me eating all the time or being skinny

After I really started pushing back when they said that kinda stuff, about how I don't want to hear them talking about my body or my weight, they started complaining about me eating when they were trying to diet.

Saying ""can you not eat at your desk outside of lunchtime, I'm only eating a small salad a day and it's frustrating to see that"" and stuff like that. I said I don't want to talk about diets, it's just not a conversation I'm comfortable with. But I got hungry more often than once a day and so I'd try to pick foods that don't smell but I might eat more. 

Then two of my coworkers went to our boss to say that I wasn't focused at work because I was always having a meal at my desk. My boss didn't take that too seriously because he knows I get me work done but it's still stressing me out.

"Thanks, Karen, for re-igniting my eating disorder ","My first year of teaching there was a teacher appreciation week. Someone brought cupcakes so I had one during my “off” period in the teachers lounge. I never ate stuff like that, but my therapist was encouraging me to eat “off-limits foods” in my recovery from anorexia.

One of the receptionists came up to me to tell me that if she could go back, she never EVER would eat things like these cupcakes to maintain a slim figure “like yours.”

I literally was recovering from a decade long eating disorder which left me very unwell.  I had to quit my sport because I was so thin I was getting multiple stress fractures from a single season of collegiate running. I weighed barely 100 pounds at 5’10”. 

I looked her dead in the eye and said “well I can eat this because I used to be so skinny I couldn’t even walk, and I’m glad I’m finally eating enough food to try to not die.”

She just stared at me until I walked away.

"If you're a binge eater, continue binge eating instead of restricting. Game the system.","I know this sounds bad, but as someone who had a piss poor relationship with food all my life up until end of last year, I feel I am now confident enough to give this advice.

Every time I tried to ""diet"" or make a ""lifestyle change,"" people would tell me I would eat because I was bored or eat emotionally or that my hunger wasn't real. News flash - my hunger was very real. I was fat, and I had a lifestyle that stretched my stomach out, and my fullness signals were all out of whack (and let's not touch on my endocrine disorders). The only thing I had to gauge fullness off of was how full my stretched out stomach was. And I felt miserable. So I'd restrict, and I'd be miserable, and eventually, I'd cave and yo-yo.

This time around, you know what I did? I replaced stuffing myself with bad food with stuffing myself with better options.

Feeling hungry? Let me grab this here entire bag of salad. Yep, the entire thing. I'll add some dressing and a handful of croutons, and that's my snack. Six cups of the stuff, even with the worst dressing, was still under 200 calories. And you know what? I felt full.

I did this for weeks, not restricting how many salads I'd have (or occasionally, steamed veggies) or when, and slowly, I guess because of how much the salad compresses, my stomach began to shrink. I needed less and less of the salad to feel ""full."" 

And eventually, I stopped needing a salad an hour after dinner at all. Now, I eat about half the portions that I used to in order to feel full, and that has a tendency to match up exactly with my calorie goals for the day (1700). And I'm not miserable.

60lbs down, no perpetual hungry feeling, no general misery, and my back hurts less.

Don't let people convince you that your feelings or urges aren't real. Instead, find a way to game them until they slowly change for the better.

Edit: Some people are missing the point. ""Just work on better earing habits"" is peak unhelpful for people who don't have properly functioning hormone and signal sensitivity. What I'm saying is to try simple alternatives, because even ""slightly unhealthy"" options are still better than completely unhealthy ones. If you're able to feel full after eating a little bit of ""filling foods,"" then this post is not for you. Please stop trying to make us feel bad. All-or-nothing approaches do not work for most people.",u99469,n/a,2022-04-22 07:44:40

I’m in this vicious cycle of hating my body because I’ve gained weight then hating myself even more because I can’t stop binge eating. I don’t know how to stop, it’s how I’ve learned to comfort myself over years and it feels like a habit that’s impossible to break. I feel like I’ve made so much progress with healing but then I’ll binge almost every night. It makes me feel like I’ve gone nowhere. 

I’m sorry this is so chaotic and I hope it makes sense. Please let me know if you have any tips or just understand how I feel.",1apibd3,n/a,2024-02-13 02:26:36
Binge Eating Tips 101 from a Dietitian Who Used to Binge Eat,"Hi all

Hope you're well. I just wanted to raise awareness with how we can end binge eating and I understand the struggle as I have been binge eating during my time at university being so full that I couldn't even lie down asleep, have had fevers from feeling too hot from so much food ingested, and been brought down that 'You don't look like you struggle with food'.

And yes, I am qualified, I am a registered dietitian who supports people struggling with binge eating specifically and have my own youtube channel and stuff. But I'm not going to advertise out loud unless you ask me as helping is first priority

So first, need to first remember: **Binge eating is NOT the problem, it's a symptom of deprivation.** Binge eating means your body senses deprivation either physically (AKA hunger) or mentally (Aka no satisfation). It's a protective mechanism against starvation. You're not broken, your hunger cues are overregulated. 

Binge eating of course can come from trauma and emotional invalidation but that can be for another post. In this post I'll explain the diet to end binge urges because at the end of the day we head to the food which leads to the binge.

**Here are the main tips I would provide and I apologise if this isn't well ordered!**

1. **Eat regular meals -** Aim to eat breakfast, mid morning snack, lunch, mid afternoon snack, and dinner. Why? Because one massive binge trigger is physical hunger and you may think that you don't have hunger but I want you to review what you do after a binge? Do you promise yourself to be more strict, skip meals, or eat less the next day? Do you try to hold off this hunger to 'make-up' for your binge? Also, skipping meals or eating very little outside your binges is training your body to not be hungry outside binge times but when binge times come (often times for most people is evening), you get a MASSIVE surge in hunger out of nowhere! Ghrelin, the hunger hormone (Increases makes us feel hungry) is dictated by our pattern so we can change when we feel hungry. So after our binges, if we avoid trying to skip meals or eat very little, we are continuing this pattern of not feeling hungry and feeling a massive craving at night for most. Eating regular meals and snacks in between and aiming to stay roughly 7/10 full throughout the whole day will re-regulate our ghrelin release. With 0/10 being nauseously hungry and 10/10 being Christmas dinner full!
2. **Eat the foods you crave -** You might be thinking I'm crazy but 'you only binge on the foods you restrict'. When I say don't think of a pink elephant - you just thought of a pink elephant! But imagine you holding off a craving for a cookie, but the thought comes across your mind about it 100 times a day - and that's just 1 food. So eat the cookie and move on! Remember, if you're following number 1 by eating regular meals and staying roughly 7/10 full you will be satisfied with a portion - and sometimes you may have a little more than a portion and that is ok! Your body is honouring it's craving until it is satisfied. If you want me to back this up with a study you can simply check 'The Psychology of Food Cravings: The Role of Food Deprivation by Meule, 2020'

***Binge Restrict cycle:*** Binge>Feel guilt>Promise to diet as hard as possible to make up for the calories eaten the next day>Binge...

**3.** **Avoid the All-or-Nothing Mindset -** The longer we are in the binge-restrict cycle, the harder try to push ourselves out of it and demand faster and faster results but remember that the binge-restrict cycle is like quicksand - the more you struggle and work harder, the more you'll sink! So if you had a binge, don't think to yourself that you've ruined everything - try to use this opportunity to learn from it - 'What did I restrict' that led me to binge? 'What could I have changed' 'Maybe I binged but were the gaps in between binges getting longer? Am I having more days where I am not bingeing? - Because that is a sign of recovery'. Remember food is always there and it will be there tomorrow and that you are always moving the right direction if you avoid feeling guilty after a binge and keep trying to give yourself more and more freedom

**4.** **Ensure your meals are balanced -** During recovery, to ensure fullness AND satisfaction together with your regular eating throughout the day in #1, **make sure your meals contain carbohydrates, fats, protein, and fibre**. Having all 4 can ensure that your meals are filling and delicious. For example if you feel like you want toast and butter for breakfast, aim to add a protein source to it like maybe cottage cheese. If you binged last night, but still want something for breakfast and have a piece a plain bagel with nothing on it, and you know you are avoiding the butter because you don't want to 'gain' weight, then that is a form of mental restriction and not honouring your cravings.

**5. Reintroduce fear foods gradually into your diet -** Make a list of 3 columns: Least feared, average feared, and most feared foods and fill them up. Contrary to popular belief, introducing the least scary will only cause more anxiety the more you go up the ladder, start with the MOST feared food but the trick is to add it after a main meal which contains protein, fats, carbs, and fibre and be 7 out of 10 full and that the meal is actually delicious so you're FULL and Satisfied then you're at the 'safest' place to introduce this fear food as a dessert.

Think of it like when you get bitten by a labrador, you start to associate this fear with all labradors, then it moves on to avoiding all dogs by fear association - but these are only assumptions. Exposure therapy is about exposing yourself at the safest situation so when you do expose yourself, you're only confirming that this not as scary. We're turning assumptions into facts. This turns fear foods into neutral foods.

**6. Eating because you are bored? -** Aim to build a routine in the evening as boredom can increase the risk of binge eating and a routine may be protective. So you may try going to the gym, go out for a walk, find a colouring book, anything to 'distract you'. If you are struggling with sleep, improving your sleep hygeine such as avoiding night time blue light in phones or laptops may be helpful, reducing or stopping caffeine, maybe taking a magnesium supplement at night may help.

***What to Expect***

You cannot be in binge-eating recovery and expect to lose weight. In fact the NICE (National institute of Care and Excellence) report that during binge eating recovery, ***weight loss is not the focus.***

People struggling with binge eating disorder often maintain their weight and during treatment also maintain their weight or gain a slight amount of weight. The key is to establish regular eating patterns.

It is not easy and to be honest, there will very likely be slip-ups and binges but **the key that will help you move forward is self-compassion.** If you recognise that you are not binging, it is the eating disorder bingeing, then you will gain more self-compassion for yourself because it is not your fault.

Recovery may take weeks or even months depending on how long and how much the binge eating has had control over your life but now is the time for you to take control! If anyone ever shames you for finding food freedom, remember that their comments is a reflection of their insecurities around food and a reflection of their relationship around food NOT yours <3

Hope that helps and let me know if you have any questions!!

[Conversation] I overcame serious binge eating disorder. Ask me anything.,"I’ve been wanting to make this post for a while, so I’ll try my hand at it (again).  This is the story of how I stopped binge eating, and I’m sharing with you because it might help.  My disclaimer is that *everyone is different*, and what worked for me might not work for you.  This post might also trigger your eating disorder.

________________________

My binge eating began after a brief stint with anorexia two years ago.  When I started eating again, I also started counting calories—something I’d never before done.  I joined MyFitnessPal and it told me to eat 1200 a day, so I did.


I made it maybe a few months, if I’m being generous, before the binges started.  I was very active—did Crossfit a few times a week, bicycle-commuted to work, hiked every weekend—and I felt like I was starving to death on 1200 calories.  Some days I would get to 3:00pm and only have 200 calories left, which I knew wasn’t going to accommodate a filling dinner or that croissant I was craving.  I tried my best to fill up on a full plate of broccoli, but it just didn’t cut it, and I’d eventually cave and eat the croissant.  Then I’d feel so guilty that I would eat the whole bag of croissants.  


Other days I’d eat something “bad,” like a cookie at work, and then feel so bad about myself—so fat and out of control—that I would eat an entire box of cookies when I got home.  Or I would plan to eat something bad, schedule my entire day around a chocolate bar, and then the obsessive thoughts would drive me into another binge.


My binge eating was a full-blown compulsive food addiction.  I did not eat things because they tasted good; in fact, most of my binges were on things I didn’t even like that much, or crazy things.  Despite disliking muffins, I would buy and binge eat an entire packet of them every Wednesday.  One time I ate an entire *pound* of raisins, washed down with three bagels.  I was sick for a week.  If there was no food in the house, I’d binge eat raw sugar.  These weren't isolated incidents--I ate this way almost every night.  Sixteen boxes of macaroni and cheese, 10 bags of popcorn, a sleeve of bagels.  


I gained around 30 lbs in a few months—from 105 lbs to 135 lbs.  None of my clothes fit.  Whereas before people might comment on my lunch salad and tell me, “You don’t need to eat salad!” now they were saying, “Did you weigh the dressing?  Those calories can really sneak up on you.”  I was ashamed to see old friends.  It felt like I was wearing my mental problems very publicly on my body.


I tried for about a year to control it by fasting, or willpower, or going to the gym three times a day (all of which made it worse).  But after a certain point, I just wanted to stop.  I no longer cared if I was pudgy or skinny or needed new jeans; I just wanted to eat normally.  

I was at my parents’ house one day when I saw the book “Intuitive Eating” on my mom’s bookshelf.  That book saved me.  You can find the [10 basic principles on their website](http://www.intuitiveeating.com/content/10-principles-intuitive-eating), but I highly recommend reading the book itself.

The first thing that I implemented was: no restrictions.  If I wanted to eat it, I ate it.  And I ate as much as I wanted of it.  And I enjoyed it the entire time.  This turned out to be huge amounts of trail mix.  Even though I was still eating way more than I needed, the simple act of allowing myself to eat it instantly started to turn things around.

After that, I started to identify the things that made me binge eat.  I can no longer remember the name of all the inner thoughts that “Intuitive Eating” names, but they talk about things like the “food police.”  The food police thoughts try to tell you that what you’re eating is bad, and not allowed.  However, when you don’t honor your hunger and eat the things that you want to eat, your body panics.  It wants bread, goddamnit, and all that lettuce isn’t bread.  It might be nutritious, but it’s not filling.

There is a process that goes on when you start intuitively eating.  You must trust that your body knows how to eat, and your body will regulate itself once you fix your obsessive thinking.  Maybe you eat a bag of candy today, but your body will balance it out by craving lettuce next week.  Maybe you eat a lot over the holidays, and when you get back to your routine, you just want some light soup.  The key is that you don’t force yourself to eat soup, or skip a meal, or eat lettuce.  You just eat whatever you want, whenever you want, and your body will make the right choices.

Mealtimes:  When I was binge eating, I only let myself eat at very specific times, because I felt like I could control the binges if I could make sure that I was on this schedule.  No more.  If I feel like lunch at 11:00am, I eat lunch at 11:00am.  If I feel like dinner at 3:00, I eat dinner at 3:00.  

Candy and other “bad” foods:  No foods are bad.  While you eat that bag of Twix bars (which I did, two weeks ago), you enjoy every last one.  There is no wrong amount of candy to eat.

Exercise:  When I was binge eating I lifted weights because I thought it was the best way to lose weight.  Unlike a lot of you ladies, I hated lifting.  I hated the gym, hated everything about it.  After I started recovering, I went back to my favorite exercises: running and yoga.  I don't run because I have to run to keep my body, or because I'm unhealthy and I need to get healthy, I run because I love running.  I do yoga because I love yoga.  Binge exercising is about as sustainable as binge eating; in the end, you have to build a lifestyle that will serve you, not a crash diet.

It’s taken me about a year and a half to get to this point, where I’m writing this post and it doesn’t trigger me at all.  It was difficult at times for me to trust the program, because I just wanted to be skinny.  But I knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that crash dieting wasn’t sustainable or going to work for me.  1.5 years later, I’ve lost 30 lbs.  

Last night I went to a restaurant and left half of my meal on my plate because I just wasn’t hungry anymore.  Two weeks ago, I ate an entire bag of candy over the span of two days.  I weigh 105 lbs again without weighing my dressing, counting calories, or restricting myself in any way.   ",2mo8dr,n/a,2014-11-18 15:52:47
"I've removed bad things (smoking/vaping, alcohol, porn, binge eating) and now don't know what else to do outside of work and gym. Same day every day.","I try to be grateful of the little things try new things. Smell the flowers, get some sun, try a new cafe or cook something new. Idk wtf else to do. I swear the last year I've done absolutely nothing but just exist and go to work while staying really fit and healthy. I don't crave alcohol anymore or vaping or porn watching or eating biscuits watching mindless crap online to 'pass time'.

But now I just feel like a complete empty boring loser. I don't know what this means now. I just exist and do the 'right' things and nobody is around in any capacity to say hey well done I'm proud of you keep going etc.

Like, I'm single as f and have no friends. Just sometimes wonder who I'm doing any of this for anyway. Can't wait to retire and then what, sit around feeling comfortable and just die in my sleep.

I feel like my life is a piece of plain white bread. And it's stale.

I work with my coworkers but don't like them. I've tried group meetups, but it was awkward as shit and full of guys. Taken the long way to work or a different way home. Listen to upbeat music in my car and at home. Sleep heaps. Eat super well. Saving money you know all that shit. But that's it. I just don't know what else.



I've read travel as a suggestion innumerable time. I'm legitimately not interested in it. I'm a homebody and that's fine with me. 

Strange existential feelings have been settling in over the last year as I live each day the same as the last. Always doing everything as I know I should but nothing new is coming up or revealing itself to me. Stuck in time but doing well. No idea.",1memb46,n/a,2025-08-01 03:48:30

Roommate won’t stop binge eating my food…,"I (30F) am temporarily renting out half of a 2bed 2.5bath condo for a 3 month contract. I live with the owner (47F). When I moved in she told me she had lost 100lbs a year or two ago without working out. I have since come to learn she has a ‘health coaching business’…. aka she is in an MLM. She only eats powdered supplements all day and has one keto meal at night. I looked into her ‘company’, it is essentially a starvation diet and the supplements are quite expensive.

None of this is a problem for me, live and let live as long as you don’t try to recruit me to the scam. The issue comes in, at least once a week she binge eats huge quantities of my food. It’s high fat, keto type foods - entire jars of almond butter, bags of shredded cheese, 1lb bags of pecans or cashews, and recently 6oz cans of fried onions. She eats these in one sitting, usually if I am away for a weekend.

She is always very apologetic, embarrassed, and immediately runs out to replace what she has eaten. I feel bad, I definitely had some periods of binge eating in my 20s, but never to the point eating someone else’s food. One time I said I was going to an event but ended up cancelling. When I came out of my room and walked into the kitchen she looked like she had seen a ghost. There was my empty bag of 8 cheese slices and her hand was in my almost finished costco bad of nuts. It is very awkward!

I have never had this issue before. I think she has some other mental health struggles and I do not want to rock the boat. Plus she does replace everything, although a few times I have had to ask her to. I’m moving out in a week or so. Should I leave this in my review of the place?

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: I am glad she replaces your food but that would be so annoying to live with.

>**OOP:** Yes sometimes I go to use things I use sparingly (butter, avocado oil) and they are gone.

Commenter: She a drank a bottle of avocado oil true or false

>**OOP:** Ha!!! No it was a spray. She had already used a full bottle, replaced that, then used that one up entirely without replacing.

Commenter: That person is destroying their liver/kidneys, between the high fat/protein binge and the powdered supplements. They'll probably wind up admitted with AKI and get yelled at by their physician.

>**OOP:** Oh absolutely. She asked me if she might have anemia because she’s so tired. I pointed out she doesn’t eat any carbohydrates and that is definitely effecting her energy levels. She said her supplements provide ‘all the nutrients that fruits and carbs have so it can’t be that’…  
>  
>I’d also be concerned for lack of fiber. I recently have been seeing that colon cancer is on the rise because diets are more processed/lack fiber from fresh produce.

Commenter: Yeah, you should. I wouldn't want to live with someone like that who hasn't taken any steps to rectify it (it's good that she replaces the food right away, but still unacceptable that she's still eating all of it in the first place).

>**OOP:** True, she has gone in my cabinets to take things out and tries to put them back exactly where they were, but I still notice. For example I always use a fork when prepping my overnight oats (feels a little easier than a spoon, maybe just a weird habit of mine), and use that fork to dig out my almond butter. A few times I’ve opened the jar and there are spoon marks, with quite a bit missing. This is also disgusting if she ate straight from the jar, which knowing her hygiene habits would not suprise me.

Commenter: This was me in my teens-20’s. I was “fit”, but my binge-restrict cycles were out of control. I was basically low grade starving myself all day and the urge to eat large quantities of high-fat, high-carb food at night was uncontrollable. Especially peanut butter. Sometimes I would do it while half-asleep. My binges would spill over into my roommates food sometimes and I would feel really bad and replace it. I’m so glad that’s all in the rear view mirror.

>**OOP:** Sounds like you are in the same spot as my roommate. Do you have any ideas on how I can compassionately approach her and tell her I think she needs some help? What would have been helpful to you during that time?

(The above commenter's response) Honestly I was so consumed by guilt and shame and uncontrollable urges, I don’t know what I would’ve needed to hear at that time. I definitely knew I had a problem. Maybe gently start with the fact that you had an eating disorder too and you know how it feels, and that you knew someone (me!) who dealt with the same thing and treatment changed their life. Granted, I’m not as small as I used to be but neither am I out of control with my weight and food. If she’s ready to embrace sanity around food over thinness, then she’ll be receptive. But I was deathly afraid of weight gain at the time so any solution that would cause my artificially low weight to stabilize upwards would’ve been met with a panic attack and extreme rejection.

But just showing empathy is a big first step. When I lived at home for a year (for ED treatment) I asked my parents to put a lock on the pantry door so I wouldn’t night eat, and that also helped. It sounds like it’s too late for you to do that - also an unfair burden on you - but just a thought. I wish I had a better answer for you, but it sounds like she needs to hit rock bottom and have a come to Jesus moment where she realizes a normal life is more important than desperately trying to lose weight in an unhealthy way.

>**OOP:** Well said, thank you for this incredibly thought out response. I think I will have a conversation with her and say I feel for her that she seems to lose control around food. I’ve had those feelings myself. But also make it clear that it bothers me. Maybe that soft boundary will be enough to push her in the right direction? I’m glad you got help!! Thank you again

*To a deleted comment:*

>She replaces stuff but then helps herself to the replacement! Her hygiene habits are…. lax…. so it really grosses me out if she is eating my shredded cheese straight out of the bag or almond butter with a spoon straight from the jar.

Commenter: Instead of replacing your food why doesn’t she just go get her own?

>**OOP:** I have no idea. Someone else commented it can be a psychological thing - if I don’t buy the ‘bad food’ myself then I won’t eat it - but then they feel out of control and see what’s sitting right there and go crazy.

Commenter: Your review of the place? Like you are going to proactively seek out a review site and post about this woman’s struggles like that, just cause? I dunno… Why?

>**OOP:** I am renting the place through a website similar to airbnb. I have used it 5 other times and you are strongly encouraged to leave reviews.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1c09ma9/update_roommate_wont_stop_binge_eating_my_food/)**: April 9, 2024 (Next Day)**

The day after I originally posted I noticed my 16oz sour cream was mostly gone and had spoon marks. I had used a fork to drizzle a small amount over nachos last time I used it, so safe to assume my roommate had eaten it. Our schedules don't always line up so I decided it would be best if I talk to her via text when she is off work. Convo went as follows:

me: hey when I was home earlier I noticed a pretty significant portion of my sour cream was gone

rm: At the store now. Was doing some work until 3am and had a low moment. I’m really sorry. Replaced by 5:15pm.

me: It’s okay you don’t need to replace. I did want to talk about it though, it bothers me when my food is missing. can you please try to avoid touching my stuff in the fridge or my cabinet?

rm: Yes.

me: I understand what it’s like to be out of control sometimes when it comes to food 🫶🏻 let me know if you ever want to talk. is there anything I can do to help make it easier to avoid?

rm: Not a good housemate trait. It’s disrespectful of your stuff and I’m sorry. I’ve been struggling lately. Thanks for bringing it up. I know I need to change

me: it is not a character flaw! life is tough enough as it is. I’ve been there before. please do not beat yourself up about it ❤️

rm: Thanks. Well, do you need anything at the grocery store while I’m here?

me: nah i’m all set thank you!

When I got home she had bought an identical new sour cream and got me flowers, has been up in her room all evening though :( A very nice gesture, I really did not need any more sour cream and was not going to come close to finishing it in the next week before I move out.

While she often takes small portions of certain things I probably wouldn't have used/noticed anyway, I mentioned in a few comments on the original post - I have other concerns of her hygiene and food safety habits. She is frankly a pretty messy/disorganized/forgetful person and frequently leaves the kitchen and living room (common areas) a mess with used dishware, crumbs/pieces of food on the couch, remnants all over the stove, dirty dishes in the sink for days, etc. I have also witnessed her several times leave meat/dairy out unrefrigerated for hours and then eat it. I do not want ANY person to eat straight out of my jar almond butter/sour cream with a spoon, or out of a bag of my shredded cheese with unwashed hands - even if it is a tiny bit. I have always been very aware and intentional of my food safety.

Thank you to everyone who shared their personal ED struggles. As mentioned I have definitely had my own journey toward a healthy relationship with food. After posting, I realized this situation may be particularly triggering to me as I believe my dad has a long history of what I think is binge-eating tendencies. As many suggested, I set a boundary with my roommate but also tried to be compassionate.

To those saying I should tear her down from being in an MLM - I don't think this would be productive in any way. Don't get me wrong I have consumed a lot of anti-MLM content and agree they are pretty universally bad. Yet I know those involved in these scammy companies sometimes view naysayers as fuel to strengthen their bond with their 'team'. I'm not touching on this with her.

Some recommended buying a mini fridge or a fridge lock box. I won't personally be doing this for my case but both good ideas. I didn't know they made fridge lockboxes, including this in the event it is helpful to anyone reading this in a similar scenario.

As far as leaving a review - I'm still torn on what to do. I rented this place through a service similar to Airbnb in which you are strongly encouraged to leave reviews. I've used it 5 times before and honestly have never had to give less than 5/5 stars. The food is a problem but also she is very messy and often dirty as well. As someone who is super neat/organized and cannot sleep if there are dishes in the sink and counters aren't wiped down - I would really struggle to give even 4/5 stars. I am not sure if I can in good faith give a highly positive review. I am considering leaving no review, but in the event I do [u/fourpuns](https://www.reddit.com/user/fourpuns/) gave me a good idea. To include the line ""occasionally ate food I had purchased but always replaced it."" Short, sweet, truthful, not malicious. I would never ever go into detail or 'out her'.

To those saying I should poison her with hot sauce, laxatives, cayenne, etc.... BE F'IN FOR REAL. That is illegal and dangerous to both of us. This is a PERSON that is struggling. You don't kick someone while they are down. Despite us not being a great match roommate-wise, she is a warm and kind person that has tried her best to make me feel welcomed in many other ways. I truly wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward.

I am moving out in a week since my contract is ending, so I have a feeling there will not be any more food problems. This has been an eye-opening experience. I hope I handled as kindly as I possibly could have while respecting my own needs. If all else fails, I like to reframe uncomfortable/difficult scenarios as something one can use in job interviews to answer 'tell me about time you faced a problem and how you fixed it.' 🤷‍♀️

Would love to hear from survivors, dietitians, or counselors in the ED sphere for ideas on how to help an acquaintance who is struggling with their relationship with food. Open to constructive criticism for any tips on how I could have used better language in our convo. For myself and others as a reference.

Thank you all!!

I’m not sure if she’s eaten anyone else’s food before. She didn’t eat anything of mine for the first month or 6 weeks I lived here. I needed to say something because it was bothering me.

I wanted to share a trick I used to curb my binge eating and maybe it'll help you too if you're struggling,"Hear me out, it might sound silly, but chopsticks. Pour your snacks into a bowl and eat your snacks with chopsticks, one at a time. A bowl of snacks that would last me a few minutes by grabbing more than one thing at a time can now last me half an hour maybe? This really helped me when I would snack while playing video games. Between games, or even during, I'd snack a ton but now, I can't use my chopsticks while I play and between games, I can only eat so many by using my chopsticks. I have decreased my intake by only needing 1 bowl of my preferred snack and it takes me longer to eat, giving me more time to digest and feel the effects of being satisfied by the snack, rather than just eating and eating.

A side effect of this trick is that you will become super good with chopsticks. Hope this can maybe helps some people as it has for me!

Working out and eating right feels good. Binge eating and skipping the gym does not. Don't let your lizard brain trick you into getting it backwards.,"Just got back into the gym after a 2 week spell of skipping for no real reason. Sipping my protein shake and realizing how good it feels, physically, mentally, and emotionally, to take concrete steps towards changing my body and lifestyle. However, this is a cycle: workout for a few days, feel great, ""deserve a cheat / rest day"", spiral out and binge eat / skip workouts for a few days, rinse and repeat. Something about the human brain hates change. The brain hates calorie counting, restriction, being told ""No!"". Sometimes its helpful to remind ourselves that working out and eating right isn't punishment for being fat. Working out and eating right is just self-care. Its the same as getting a good night's rest or taking a shower. No real purpose to this post other than to get some thoughts and emotions on paper (or keyboard). Feeling hopeful right now. :) 

edit: I can't reply to each comment, but the response to this post has been incredible. To all of those who have said this post helped them to get back in the gym or avoid an unnecessary binge, I am profoundly happy to know that my post had a positive effect on you. Keep grinding, we're all going to make it. :) ",ax9ymt,n/a,2019-03-04 17:47:12
I had an emotional binge eating episode and my husband's reaction made me cry,"Obligatory mobile user apologies. I've struggled with my weight for my whole life (27F) coming from a family where health and exercise wasn't considered a necessity and my mom made consistently poor quality meals. I'm married now, two kids of my own and I'm very good about healthy eating, and we even grow some of our own foods in our organic garden, so I've been able to manage my weight quite well in my twenties. It's been a stressful week and last night I stayed up too late watching Letterkenny and straight plowing my way through some leftover Easter candy. I was absolutely ham, I was just so distraught and upset and basically, I felt better afterwards, even though it was a bad thing to do. Then I fell asleep and forgot about it. Cue this morning, I'm getting dressed and notice the candy wrapper pile I'd accumulated last night is gone. My husband notices this and cheerfully says he cleaned it up already, and that he was jealous, I should have invited him to my late night candy party! Honestly I was just wanting to burst into tears. How wonderful to hear something like that when all I had for myself were condescending thoughts, hurt feelings and angry judgement for myself. It was so sweet, the gesture and the statement. He loves me even when I'm a wreck. I really feel like i don't deserve him sometimes.",gbjvme,n/a,2020-05-01 15:11:41
Do you struggle with binge eating?,"Sometimes when I’m home avoiding my avoidable tasks as usual I start “getting hungry” too many times along the day, consciously unconscious (if that’s a thing) like feeling guilty but ignoring it and eating anyway and by the end of the day I’m very full and feeling very guilty. Have you dealt with this? What do you do when that happens?",ognru5,n/a,2021-07-09 04:07:08
Would you say something to another mom if her kid binge-eating sweets during playdates?,"My 9-year-old has a friend who comes over every so often and has an issue with binge eating sugary, processed food. 

She never asks, but instead sneaks off and eats a lot. Yesterday, while the other girls were outside playing, she kept going back into my daughter’s room to eat her school Easter candy and claw machine prizes. She also told the other girls to distract me so she could raid the pantry. She ended up eating the equivalent of an entire bag of candy out of the claw machine, plus a bunch of pantry snacks—including six Jello cups she stuffed into her pockets, 6 individually wrapped chocolate cookies, half a box of gummy worms, and panda cookies that go in my daughter's lunches. All in all, she probably ate around 3,000 calories of sugary treats. My daughter didn't tell me what she was up to until afterwards and was somewhat upset about it. 

This isn’t a one-time thing. Something has happened on every visit. On a birthday trip we took together once, she licked dropped cake off the hotel carpet.

I’m not trying to shame anyone—I remember being a kid and going overboard with sugar too—but I can’t help wondering if something else is going on. We’re not close with her mom, so I feel weird and a little embarrassed bringing it up. I also worry that it might come off as judgmental.

Would you say something? Or just quietly manage the situation when she visits? I think next time I'm going to have to put all prepackaged sweets in my room so I can lock the door. I offered the kids snacks - blueberry muffins, pretzels, fresh fruit, and cheese which she didn't touch. Plus she had just had a full lunch right before she arrived. This is only an issue with processed foods. ",1jzclht,n/a,2025-04-14 22:59:15
The answer on how to ACTUALLY stop binge eating - Ride the Craving Wave!,"Two years ago, I attended a 6-week workshop called ""Craving Change"" to help overcome overeating. I learned a lot. The first two weeks were about taking note of emotions before, during and after eating. Interestingly, like addicts with drugs, the brain lights up most in the moments immediately BEFORE we consume. It's not about the actual eating/food. We also worked through what triggers the overeating - a time, place, person, feeling, etc. We identified if hunger was really ""stomach hunger"" (physical hunger) or if it was ""mouth"" (all about the taste/texture) or ""heart hunger"" (filling a need that has nothing to do with hunger, often emotional, but also could be a habit or wanting to please others, etc.) 

I used to have very problematic eating in the evenings and could easily munch on 1000s of calories to the point where I felt absolutely stuffed/sick. I have shared this method often in the comments and it always gets a lot of positive feedback, so I thought it deserved its own post. I will probably also keep commenting about it when people ask, so sorry if you've read this before!

My workshop had a repertoire of skills to try out and choose from to help stop problematic eating behaviours. The one that worked the best for me was to **visualize an ocean wave and ""ride the craving wave.**"" Like a wave on an ocean, a craving slowly builds up. It then becomes very big, powerful, overwhelming. But then with time, it crests, falls, and the ocean returns to calm. You can imagine your craving like a wave. It will pass with time. 

Day 1, **wait 30 seconds** before giving into the craving. Then **give yourself permission to eat** whatever you are craving with **no judgement**. The next time, add 30 seconds to your wait time. Keep incrementally adding time each time you feel a craving. Eventually you will wait 5 minutes, 10 minutes... Research shows that **a craving can pass after 15-20 minutes**, so you may not even want the thing anymore! During your wait time, actually picture the ocean wave in your mind, picture it as it gets stronger, and visualize the moment when it will return to calm.

While I am riding out the wave, I also like to repeat to myself my favourite mantras and quotes. What is your favourite motivational quote/mantras?

*The time is going to pass anyway, you might as well spend it working towards your goals.*

*You will never always be motivated, so you must learn to always be disciplined.*

*There is no one big step that does it. It is a lot of little steps.*

I pair all this with even more strategies: have a big glass of water, tea, or flavored seltzer water while you are waiting. Remove yourself from the place (go for a walk, get off the couch and tidy up, etc.) Call a friend. Work on hobby (something that involves hands is best.) Brush your teeth. Journal.

**The biggest first step is to PAUSE before eating**. Take note of why you are eating, either mentally or actually writing it down. Then choose to eat if you want, but now at least you know why you are doing it. Eventually, with practice, I am able to keep my goals in mind and have those be stronger than any cravings. Now that even more time has passed where eating in the evenings isn't a thing for me anymore, the cravings often don't come at all. I have a much healthier relationship with food.

The hardest part about weightloss is not diet or exercise - it's PATIENCE. It takes a long time. I constantly remind myself that we are in this for the long haul. We are in this for life! If I have a bad day, I log it and move on - the most important thing is getting right back to it the next day. It's about sticking with it. *Dedication and persistance will pay off over time.* 

Good luck everyone. Try this out and remember to be patient with yourself. It really works!",pm6v5t,n/a,2021-09-11 12:50:49
Anyone else been binge eating since childhood?,"No shade to my young adult starvation -> binge eating people but I cannot relate. I've been binge eating since I was in elementary school. My very first memory involves food (eating straight butter out of a dish at my grandma's house). I would sneak food like crazy and was very fat.

Helpful trick with binge eating at night,"This has helped me immensely so I thought I would share in case it can help others. My husband and I have a toddler and our days are pretty stressful/exhausting. Pair that with sleep regressions and frequent colds (thanks daycare) and you have two adults that enjoy unwinding in front of the television with some snacks. 

Well my snacking has been out of control lately and I started to associate the couch with eating. Even if I was full, I would find myself in the pantry as soon as I realized I was empty handed on the couch. 

A few days ago I picked up some non-caffeinated tea at the grocery store. I decided to make a cup at night while watching one of our shows. Fast forward to today and I have completely replaced my snacking habit with tea! It fills my empty hands and gives me something to look forward to at night. Plus I have fun picking out different flavors at the store (pomegranate white tea is my current fav) and feel like I’m giving my body something good for it. I guess the old wisdom of replacing a bad habit with a good one worked! Hope this helps someone!",o6kh4z,n/a,2021-06-23 19:49:11

How on Earth do you stop binge eating for comfort when you are depressed?,"Honestly? I have been depressed for my whole life and spent years eating for comfort to help myself feel better.

"I don't like people telling me ""It's okay to have one cheat day"" and trying to pressure me into binge eating.","I can not eat like you do, I have an unhealthy relationship with food. You wouldn't take a recovering alcoholic out to drink, and then tell them ""one night out with the boys isn't gonna hurt"" so please don't say it to me either

Going out to binge eat with your friends might be a great time for a lot of people, but for me binge eating is tied to a very dark time in my life. I was 400 lbs, ate 4000-5000 calories a day, I hated myself and wanted to stop, but I couldn't. When I ate I could turn my brain off for a bit and ignore how terrible everything was around me, and I did that as much as I could. It took a lot of work, but after all that effort I was able to give up that coping mechanism.

I still enjoy eating, and I still have a bit of that escapism from it, but it is all under strict control. I log stuff before I eat it, and if I can't log it accurately, I don't have it. I do not have any cheat days, I have not had a cheat day in two years.

Yes, it is strict, but I do not want to change it. I am much happier now without that short term contentment of binge eating. Trust me, I am not depriving myself of joy by declining food, if you feel like you are excluding me because I am not eating anything then the solution is to pick places to hang out that don't center on food, not to try and pressure me into binge eating.",u01ipn,n/a,2022-04-09 20:25:49
Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"I'm 5'11 and 240 pounds. I classify as obese. 

I've been overweight the majority of my whole life and have had struggles with binge eating for the past 4-5 years. I still go to the gym 5 times a week and run 4 miles 4 times a week. 

We talk about why I had urges, how to prevent them aka eating at different times, making sure I eat 3 meals a day, etc. The stuff I basically already have heard before. 

We later on talk about how there's ""health at every size"" and how you can still be overweight and healthy, perhaps even obese. **Now, I'm not completely against the idea. I'm not saying that this is false. Let me make that ABUNDANTLY clear.** However, there are many problems with being overweight and obese that go even beyond the superficial if you are in that unhealthy spectrum. 

Joint issues, heart issues, sleep issues, etc. 

She was also  against calorie and macro tracking. Which was also a huge red flag. I do understand that some people are against it and are big on intuitive eating. That's simply not me and never will be. I respect the science of calories in and calories out, because well...it works. 

So overall, you have to lose weight the way YOU want to. Professionals don't always have the best advice for you specifically. If you're comfortable with intuitive eating, go for it. If you count calories and macros, you could go for that too. But overall, you're going to have to dig deep and find some reason to keep going and be your own best coach. It's pretty heartbreaking but unfortunately it's the truth. 

Nobody's gonna save you but you.",pym9qr,n/a,2021-09-30 15:34:51
Finally figured out how to stop binge eating,"Okay so I’ve always struggled with binge eating junk food, especially confectionaries. I would have phases where I’d try to cut it out completely, or exercise self-control but more often than not, it would not last. Now, I have realised that the only way for me not to binge is to not buy packets of anything that have more than one serving. If I want a cookie, I go to Lidl/m&s and get a single cookie from the bakery. Before, I used to get those packet of four from Tesco, Sainsbury’, Morrisons and I would always end up finishing the whole thing. If I want cereal, I get a mini box(I always used to end up having multiple bowls of kraves or such). If I want chocolate, I buy a single bar not a packet.

I found it important to realise that I genuinely cannot exercise self control when there is a giant packet of chocolates or whatever it is in front of me. I might not finish it entirely but I’ll definitely have more than the prescribed single serving size on the packet. And it is not our fault because processed food is designed to have maximum palatability. I know I can’t cut out processed food entirely but I can control how much of it I buy and set myself up for success.

I hope this gives someone out there struggling with binge eating an idea of one way to mediate their tendencies.",1k4pb1j,n/a,2025-04-21 21:32:42

Binge-eating disorder (only late at night) - what worked for you guys?,"When I was in my teens I was obese, 15 years on and a lot of miles later I'm training for my first ultra. It may sound well and good - and to many I have 'beat my demons' - but I still have a binge-eating disorder.

I should be happy as anything given the pain cave I finally came out of but instead I'm constantly in depressing food abstinence or caning 5 chocolate bars in a row. Once I pop, I don't stop. Every night is a battle and I'm sick of it.

I am considering seeing a psychiatrist but corona etc.

I was wondering what is working for some of you guys?

The problem is only in the evenings. In the day I usually fast with absolutely no problems but the craving for a 'nightcap' food equivalent is too much.

How I Quit Binge Eating - A Guide for those who struggle,"
I used to binge eat 3x times a week in an excess of 3,000 calories or more. Food had an incredible amount of power over me. I was scared to go places because I was worried I would binge eat. I won't go over how it got to that place. But I'll tell you how I got out and now have the healthiest relationship with food that I've ever had.

#Step 1 - Understanding

**Reading List**
*Kathryn Hanson - Brain Over Binge
*Dr. Livingston - Never Binge Again
*Jack Trimpey - Rational Recovery + Taming the Feast Beast
*Charles Duhigg - The Power of Habit

The four books listed above are what gave me a good understanding of what binge urges really were and what was causing my binge urges.

###Insight 1 - All binges are caused by the urge to binge. 
You only binge to cope with the urge to binge and get the subsequent anxiety/anticipatory relief from the craving. This is explained best by Kathryn Hanson, although she is really taking Jack Trimpey's concept in RR and applying it to binge eating. There is no greater meaning to your binges. Thinking otherwise will actually validate your binges and make it harder to stop! Many things may trigger an urge, but the actual binge itself is always caused by the thought along the lines of ""Hey let's binge eat right now"". Everyone gets stressed, bored, angry, etc. But not everyone binges because they don't get the urge in the first place because they never developed that habit.


###Insight 2 - The urge to binge is not you, and comes from a different part of your brain that has no access to your voluntary muscles. 
This explains your ambivalence towards binge eating. Part of you REALLY wants to stop (why else you be reading a post called how to stop binge eating?), but part of you feels like it wants to binge eat. The part of you that wants to stop, is the real you, and the part that says binge eat can be dismissed.


###Insight 3 - You have total control over your voluntary movements and nothing - no thought, feeling, or sensation - can make you binge eat. 
Again going back to ""all binges are caused by the urge to binge"". Let's do a thinking exercise. Think about shaving your head right now. Really think about it and try to let that thought move your hands. No matter how much you try to convince yourself to shave your head, your hands probably haven't moved an inch. Because you actually don't want to shave your head. And you actually don't want to binge eat either, but you get tricked into thinking you do by thinking that thoughts that encourage binge eating have meaning or significance. If you can accept with 100% commitment that you NEVER want to binge eat and that all thoughts, feelings, and sensations telling you to binge eat are garbage, things become a lot easier. Accept that you have total control - NOTHING can make you binge eat, especially not mere thoughts. You are not powerless. 


###Insight 4 - Binge eating is nothing more than a really bad habit. 
How your binge eating habit started doesn't matter because now it wired into your brain. Your cravings to binge are just generated neurological impulses to carry out a habit in the same way that your urge to brush your teeth at night is from the same process. There is no greater meaning to your binges. Recognizing the cue for the habit (binge eating) and the reward (relief from the craving) can give you the space you need to stop immediately acting on the habit.


Again all of this makes a lot more sense if you read the books.


#Step 2 - Putting new beliefs into practice
My pivotal moment was doing the crash course in addictive voice recognition technique (AVRT) on Jack Trimpey's [website](http://www.rational.org/index.php?id=36). Mentally replace alcohol/drugs with binge eating, when you read through it. That was the thing that did it - that empowered me to fully stop binge eating. I had the power to stop all along. Using Kathryn Hanson's advice in Brain Over Binge, I dismissed all thoughts that encouraged binge eating. Before, a thought about binge eating would make me wildly upset, I'd get in a frenzy, panic, get angry/sad/annoyed, cave, and binge. Now I hear those thoughts with detachment. They can't make me do anything. And once you stop binge eating and acting out on these thoughts, the cravings and urges diminish over time.


#Step 3 - Getting back to normal eating


###1. Neutralize Food: The single greatest thing you can do for your mental and physical wellbeing (after you stop binge eating, of course) is to not let food have so much power over you. 
Stop treating food like a drug, a medicine, like this great unstoppable force, like your reason for living. It's just a donut. You can eat it and the universe will not explode. You can also not eat it, and likewise you'll be fine. The importance and power you give to food creates stress and causes you to obsess over it. ""Should I eat it or shouldn't I?"" over and over and over debating in your head as if your decision will cause WWIII. It's not that high stakes! Seriously. No other inanimate object likely causes you this much stress. Think of food in the same way, i.e. neutrally.


###2. Neutralize food obsession.
Normal people are not thinking about food all day outside of their meals. They get hungry, but they don't treat hunger as an emergency. It's just a sensation that doesn't need to be immediately satisfied. If you find yourself anxiously waiting for your next meal or obsessing/fantasizing about food, 1) don't judge those thoughts, 2) accept that they are there/don't try to get rid of them, and 3) don't get so wrapped up in them (this is basically mindfulness meditation 101 btw). These thoughts are no different than thoughts about binge eating. Neutralizing these thoughts and not letting them have power over you will allow you to move on and get back to what you were doing.


###3. Eating normally.
My eating plan now is very simple - 2-3 meals a day, no snacks. Generally I try to eat when hungry, stop when I'm full, which sounds simple but it used to feel impossible to do. But whenever I feel those crazed, frenzied thoughts saying ""Eat! Eat! Eat!"" that encourage me to act impulsively around food, I take a step back and think ""Bruh it's just food."" I relax basically and don't listen to those thoughts.
Now for those of you with more complex eating issues, this is where Dr. Livingstone's Never Binge Again comes in. He used to be obese and used the philosophy along Jack Trimpey's Rational Recovery to solve his bad food habits. [https://www.eatlikeanormalperson.com/](https://www.eatlikeanormalperson.com/) is also a good website for a simple eating plan. She also had binge eating disorder for years and was obese but overcame her food issues. 

4. This one is sort of an aside but don't food orgasm. You know when you're eating something really tasty or you're eating when you're super HUNGRy and you're thinking ""oh my fucking god this is sooooooOOOOoooOOO good!!!"" and you're in like complete ecstasy? Stop doing that. You're treating food like a drug. Be grateful for food. Find pleasure in food and see it as an enjoyable activity. But for god's sake don't food orgasm. #NeutralizeFood

Finally as a closing note, I'd like to say that all of these things are skills that you can develop. Having the right mindset -- believing that you can stop, that you never want to binge eat, that you have 100% power over your voluntary movements, etc. -- will be a huge asset in your journey.

PS. All of the books listed can be found online for free except for Jack Trimpey's book, but he does offer a free course on his website.",g2v0wh,n/a,2020-04-17 04:33:39
Just because you go keto it doesn’t mean that binge eating tendencies disappear.,"Ugh. This is mostly a mini rant.
I have been doing keto for 5 weeks. I’m doing well and happy. Most of the time I’m not that hungry, but some days I get crazy hungry and just get the munchies. It might be the Easter holiday mindset creeping in from the past, but today is feeling like a struggle. I’ve been avoiding keto treats because sweets tend to trigger my desire to binge eat and this is the first year that I can remember that I have passed on Easter candy, but I really want to dive head first into a bag of jelly beans and some Cadbury eggs.

AITAH for reporting my wife for bringing me snacks in the hospital?,"I am 32 and male. About two years ago, I was diagnosed with Binge Eating Disorder. To put it simply, I eat compulsively, even when not hungry. My BMI is 43, putting me in the Class III obesity range.

Since my diagnosis, I have not improved whatsoever. Therapy and support groups have a positive effect on my mentality, but even two hours after I'll be in line at a drive-through. It has affected my health, my mental health, my finances, and of course my wife.

My wife is 37. She is average-sized and eventually agreed that I may need actual medical intervention. After a lot of deliberation, we packed up and temporarily moved states so I could participate in an inpatient program as part of a research study. Apparently, intervention programs for BED can be pretty hit or miss, and so this one is a new take on them, being six months instead of the typical 30 to 90 days.

I am currently at the end of my first month, and everything is going very well. I've made a lot of friends in the program as well. At the end of the one-month mark, visitation opened up and my wife could now visit me. Obviously she jumped at the chance and came to visit me two days ago.

We headed over to my room, where she took her backpack off and pulled out jalapeno chips and colas--two of my most common binge items. At first I freaked out, but she explained that I ""deserved a break"" and went into detail about how much trouble she went through to smuggle them through. I immediately shouted for a nurse who forcefully removed the products from her hands and then escorted her out of the hospital with a full team. 

My wife has now been completely banned from the premises. And she's furious at me. The nurses and doctors have expressed nothing but gratitude and told me that had I indulged I would have instantly been removed from the program. 

One thing that my wife said that made me think she had a point was instead of telling her to put the snacks away and take them home, I went for the nuclear option of calling other people. I know that her bringing me snacks was objectively wrong, but was my reaction over the top?",1dh4p0g,n/a,2024-06-16 10:28:30
"NSV- I suffer from Binge Eating Disorder. Today, I ordered Chipotle and didn’t eat it all in one sitting.","Hey y’all, first time posting here! I’ve been on a weight loss mission since November 2019 [F 5’2”/SW: 184 CW: 154 GW: 129], doing CICO, stringent calorie counting and an hour of exercise 6 days a week. For the most part, things have been going well. I’ve definitely battled feelings of inadequacy due to how slow I feel like I’m losing. That slowness in losing is heavily due to the fact that I have disordered eating. I suffer from BED, have purged in the past, and have no connection with my biological hunger cues whatsoever. This has caused several lost weeks due to binging the calories I burned through cutting.

Today is my day off, however, and I ordered Chipotle. I ordered chips and queso, and a burrito bowl. I ate about a quarter of my burrito bowl, about half of the chips and less than half of the queso. A would-be 1800 calorie binge turned into a 700 calorie meal. I didn’t even go over my calories for a cutting day. This is HUGE for me. And I actually recognize that I feel full. Slow progress is progress, my dudes. Making small, sustainable changes leads to results that will last. I couldn’t be happier.

Edit:

Yo, I was expecting 30 upvotes and a “good job”. 😅 the amount of support I have received here is WILD. Thank you all so much. One thing I was not expecting was how lonely the road to weight loss would be. Seeing the support y’all are giving me makes me feel a lot less alone. Stay gold, Ponyboy.",iljmz7,n/a,2020-09-03 00:59:53
What’s one “healthy” habit you realized was secretly sabotaging your weight loss?,"For me, it was doing fasted workouts every morning because I thought it would help burn more fat.

I’d wake up, drink coffee, and train without eating, felt “hardcore” at first… until I realized I was:

* Crashing mid-workout
* Binge eating later in the day
* Feeling super drained and moody

Once I started eating a small snack beforehand (like half a banana or protein shake), I had more energy and found it easier to stay in control later in the day.

Sometimes what feels healthy isn’t helping at all.

Curious: what’s one “healthy” habit you let go of that made your progress actually better?",1lw9wsj,n/a,2025-07-10 11:05:33
Being fat ruined my life,"Literally every problem I (36F) have is because I can't stop eating. I want to change but I don't know if I ever will. 

I'm broke because I spend too much money on junk food.

I haven't bought any new clothes because everything I tried on in the dressing room looked terrible. I hate looking at the mirror.

I don't apply for higher paying jobs because I'm worried about what to wear at the interview. 

I'm too insecure about my body to date or have sex. 

I don't like going to events or meeting new people because I fear people will judge me.

My parents are disappointed in me.

I avoid the doctor because I don't want to find out I have pre-diabetes. My mom is pre-diabetic and my grandfather died of diabetes related complications in his 60s. If I don't change, it's almost guaranteed I will get it. And it will be my fault. Knowing all of this, I still had one of the worst binge eating episodes in a long time this weekend.

I'm 5'3"" and 200lbs. I'm always tired. I've had heartburn so terrible that I thought I was having a heart attack.

A week ago, I vowed to lose weight. The most I did was wake up early a few times this week to go to the gym. I already take antidepressants, I don't want to also take Ozempic. I don't want to have GLP-1 subscription for the rest of my life. I probably wouldn't be able to afford it anyway. 

By the time I reach my goal, I'll be nearly 38 years old. It'll probably be too late for me to live the life I truly want anyway. Being fat really did ruin my life.

**EDIT:** Wow. I did not expect so many comments. Thank you everyone! I may not get a chance to respond to every comment but I will read every single one. I will write down every piece of advice here in a notebook, seek professional help and find out what is best for me. 

**EDIT:** I recently switched to a new therapist and told her some of my issues with body image. Sometimes I forget to take my medication, so it's not as effective as it should be. I usually talk about stuff like family problems, being on the spectrum and social anxiety but I am going to talk to her about my plans on seeing a doctor.

**EDIT:** In the past decade: I have tried HCG Diet, WW, Noom, 6-Week Weight Loss Challenge, starving for nearly two days and probably more stuff I don't remember. WW, Noom and 6 Week Challenges do work if you commit to them. I've lost as much as 25 pounds before gaining it back :(

**EDIT:** I wasn't always fat despite always having a huge appetite. I was athletic. I even played sports as a kid. I preferred playing outside over TV and video games.  To make a long story short, things changed during adolescence and I became withdrawn and anxious. The only time I even got close to a normal weight as an adult was when I went from 168 to 145 when I was 18. All I did was start eating slightly better. I stayed around 145-155 throughout my early twenties. I hated my body back then too. Now, I'll be grateful if I ever get close to 145 again. ",1jpb35i,n/a,2025-04-02 00:10:09
Obese woman-child president of HOA I'm not a part of had a fatal heart attack while feuding with me ,"Just to preface, yes this did take place in the USA. And no I won't say where. I'll include a TLDR as well. I live bordering a former HOA. It shut down about a year ago. My property is the closest one to them, but far enough away that it does not fall in their jurisdiction since I am not on their street. My property is next to their street, and my driveway enters from the main road. The HOA's road is more than a half mile of houses. Some really old, But the street was redeveloped in the 90s or so. And after that, an HOA was started. You go from a country road and then take a right turn, and bam, you're in semi-suburbia. There are large farms on each side of the former HOA road. The oldest houses were among those owned by the HOA board. And there is also an old small elementary school that was converted into a home by one of the board members. And that was also where the HOA had all their meetings.

When I moved into the area a couple of years ago, it was because I'd come into some money from inheritance, and decided to buy a semi-suburban small town property that had been vacant for several years after the previous house that was on it burned down. The land itself was cheap and heavily overgrown with brush. Once cleared out, I had a manufactured home put there. There was even an existing chain link fence with a gate that kept the property lines well divided. I had enough inheritance money to pay for about 50% of all this without effecting my prior savings. And the rest I had to take on a mortgage for. It's just the sort of property I wanted. A little place of my own where I can work remotely. And if I ever have to move, I can probably sell the place for roughly three times what I paid for it. But I hope to stay here as long as I can. I'm the type who likes to stay firmly planted somewhere. And I hate traveling.

I'd only been living in my current abode for a few days when I suddenly began getting trouble from the nearby HOA. The rotund HOA president showed up along with a couple of her board members on a trio of mobility scooters like they were some kinda biker gang. They had notepads in hand and creepy smiles that I can only describe as looking like they already won from the moment they'd arrived. I made the mistake of leaving my gate unlocked, and they just let themselves in. But they quickly learned I was not gonna let them force me into joining their little club. Before I could even tell them to get out, they'd already spread out. The president was giving me a pitch that the HOA was mandatory, and the other two people started telling me about all the bylaws I was supposedly in violation of. One of them being the state of my grass. Which was at the time almost non-existent because the ground had been leveled and re-seeded when my house was set up. I had none of their attitudes, and told them to leave. They refused and said they had a right to be there, and actually stated that my information from real estate that my property wasn't in their jurisdiction was wrong. I told them that was a stupid lie, and to get off my property. They refused to leave, so I had enough and went into my house, then came back out my old 22 rifle I've had since I was a kid, and threatened them with it. It's just a 22, but it's not a small rifle. So it looks intimidating enough

They lost their minds in panic at the sight of the rifle, and actually called the police on me instead of clearing out when I told them to. But the police sided with me after they arrived because the HOA board were all trespassing, and I was was fully within my rights to defend my own property. The stunned looks on their faces were gold when the police took my side, and told them to leave me alone since I was not in their HOA. The president whined about it repeatedly. But it did nothing because the cops also agreed I was not in the HOA's area of control, and they were overreaching their authority. Then they were all then forced to leave. Somehow they thought I'd be a pushover just because I look young. I was 36 at the time, and people still often mistake me for being mid 20s. I had a babyface growing up, and even tried growing a mustache for a while to look more mature. Didn't work out very well.

The HOA didn't quit trying to make me join. At first I was just getting membership applications in the mail. But then they started getting more passive aggressive. One of the board members even waited for me at my gate about a couple of weeks after the first incident just to tell me that my refusing to conform was ruining neighborhood moral. I reminded him I'm not in his neighborhood, and he told me he could have me shunned if I didn't join. I actually laughed at him for that. I bought a country property to be left alone. Go ahead and shun me. I've got my own friends in the nearby city if I want to see them. Then told the guy to stay away from my property. And if he ever trespassed again, I'd have him arrested. Right after that I started getting warnings in the mail for supposed infractions I'd committed. They actually sent me repeated warnings over the re-seeded grass. Did they not understand how newly planted grass grows? It takes a while to fill in. Then it stopped being warnings, and they sent me a long list of fines they expected me to pay. The fines were for me for having a gate, the gate being yellow, preventing mandatory inspection of my land and house, owning a firearm, having a car in the wrong color, my fence being old and rusty (It was already there when I bought the land), my fence being too tall (6 feet), my driveway not being paved (It's gravel), and they didn't consider my recently installed at the time metal shed an approved building. But that wasn't all. There were more fines going back years to the previous property owners, and the period my property sat vacant and overgrown. They actually expected me to pay in total they thirty thousand dollars.

I was especially livid after they had sent me that list of bogus fines, because they'd have had to have trespassed on my property just to know some of the things they were fining me for. Honestly I think they were just making up rules at some point to claim I'd broken them. I walked the neighborhood, and there were plenty of other rusty fences, patchy lawns, gravel driveways, cars the same color as mine, etc. I had to calm myself down with a drink, and then wrote a letter back stating I was not in the HOA, never will be, and would not pay anything to them. Especially not for anything from before I ever even owned the property. I also made it clear their attempts to fine me were blatantly illegal, if not outright fraud, and would not hold up in court. After that, my garbage can was vandalized after I put it out before going to work. It looked like it'd been cut up with an electric saw or something. I called the cops. But there was little they could do with no witnesses.

I had enough and paid a security company to come set up cameras. The HOA board took notice of the work vehicle from the security company as I saw the same two board members who previously harassed me sitting on scooters and watching from the end of my driveway. They clearly took my threat of retaliation seriously, because I got no more fake fines, and my trash can was never touched again. But they still kept sending me membership applications weekly, and even letters practically begging I just join to keep the peace. So I started mailing them back with ""NO!"" written in black sharpie on the envelopes. And even a letter threatening to wipe my ass with their applications before sending them back. And even that didn't make it stop. For a while I could not for the life of me figure out why they were so desperate to make me join. Turned out their elderly woman-child of an HOA president had practically become obsessed with some crazy plan she was calling HOA Zone Expansion. And was making it a hill to die on since the HOA could not legally expand beyond it's street without permission from surrounding property owners. And I highly doubt any of them would agree to join. I was just target #1 because I was the closest. And they wanted to make an example of me.

I just kept rebuffing the HOA's repeated attempts to contact me. Until one morning about three months after I'd moved in, I found my driveway blocked by a large transit van outside my gate. It was the HOA president, and she was blocking me in so she could personally make demands of me. I don't know why she bothered to use her van to block me in. She was already big as a whale, and could have just stood there herself. I even started calling her President Whale behind her back because she was morbidly obese to the My 600 Pound Life level, and often wore blue and white. She had on what I can best describe as a business jacket over a moo-moo dress, hair in a tight bun, big grandma glasses, and a beaded necklace with a big wooden cross hanging from her neck. And I'm not exaggerating when I say she usually had some kind of food in her hands. Like almost every time I saw her. Even during this interaction she stopped to eat. From what I learned of her later, she was a widow. And her husband was an obese person like her, that ate himself into his grave during his 50s. As for President whale. I do believe she had something very mentally wrong with her. But I wasn't sympathetic after what she tried to do to me.

Back to her van blocking me in. I told President Whale to move her damn vehicle, or I'd be calling the effing police on her. She scolded me like an old church lady for my choice of language, and said she didn't have to move because the HOA owns the road. And since I refused to join the HOA, or pay the fines, she was landlocking me in. Even I knew this was very illegal, and asked if she was mental, because I'm not even on the HOA's road. I'm on the main road the HOA road branches from. She refused to listen to me, so I started getting ready to call police. She tried to stop me from calling and claimed she just wanted to negotiate. I told her there was nothing to negotiate. She was blocking me in illegally, and I would be calling cops if she didn't move her van ASAP. But she pretended not to even hear me and said that if I just filled out the forms to join the HOA, all of my problems would go away. Then she went on a ""The HOA is so great!"" sales pitch, and refused to stop till I told her she was trying to act like a mafia boss, and the HOA was the source of all my problems she was claiming would go away. Then I said that all the junkfood she was eating was rotting her brain. She called me a petulant child. I reminded her I was a grown ass man, and she was a hypocrite to call me petulant when she was the one illegally blocking me in to try and blackmail me into joining her HOA.

She had the nerve to say what she was doing was morally right, and for the good of the community. I said back that it wasn't, it was just to satisfy her own ego, and blackmail is illegal. I also pointed out she wasn't being a good Christian by wearing a cross and claiming such lies. She rolled up the HOA forms and aimed to swat me with them. I had enough and finally called the police. Whale started screaming at me to hang up the call while attempting to chase me around and hit me. But the slow pile of blubber couldn't even get near me. After only a couple of attempts, she stopped and started wheezing. And then she started yelling to try and get the police on the phone to think I was attacking her. I called her out for this, and reminded her I have cameras. She immediately stopped and then waddled back to her van a tired sweaty mess. We stared each other down for around 20 minutes while she sat in the side of her van and stuffed her face before the cops showed up. They were initially unsure what was going on because of Whale's prior screaming when I called. But I had video from my dash-cam and my house to show I'd never laid a finger on her.

President Whale tried to make a big show of fake panic, and said I was dangerous. But the police told her to move her van as she was illegally blocking my driveway. She refused and said the road was the HOA's. But the cops said it wasn't the first time they'd been called because of her harassment in the area, and also stated that the road she was currently on, was not the HOA's road. And the road the HOA itself is on, is county owned, not private. Which was news to me. But it meant she couldn't do this, even if I was on the HOA's road. Then she was bluntly told she cannot block access to anyone, and to move the van right away, or be cited. She tried to argue further, so they ticketed her on the spot, and threatened to arrest her and have the van towed if she didn't comply. She gave us all death glares and finally moved the van. I arrived to work about an hour late that day. But with an interesting story to tell.

Not too long later I was served a small claims lawsuit from Whale. She was suing me for the cost of the fine she had to pay for the citation police gave her, and for emotional distress I caused that was affecting her health. I pretty much looked at the letter and laughed, because I was ready to pick that land whale apart in court. But then the HOA tried another dirty move around the same time. I was soon notified by my bank that someone was attempting to put a lien on my property for 30k. The same amount as what the HOA tried to previously fine me. I finally got a lawyer, and the lien was soon canceled because it was groundless. I filed counter lawsuits against Whale and the HOA for harassment. I also personally went to see the HOA board at their next meeting to tell them off for what they'd tried to do, and that I'd see them in court. Whale actually had one of those little wooden gavel mallets, and was repeatedly striking it on the table that she was sitting at. She pounded it on the table while yelling ""NOOOO!"" every time I tried to speak. The rest of the HOA board had to tell her to stop, and even took the gavel from her hand like she was a child that needed a time-out. She went on a tangent about how she was in charge. But the rest of the board told her to she needed to pack up and go home for the day. But she refused and just sat there with her arms crossed and pouting.

I talked with the rest of the board, and they tried to deny any involvement in the past things Whale had done to me. Including the attempted lien, which was only her doing apparently. I called those as outright lies, and pointed out how several of the board members had previously harassed me in person along with whale at my house, and they were also likely the ones who snuck onto my property to write more fines until I put cameras up. Because I certainly wouldn't figure Whale was the one climbing over my gate and trudging around like that with how fat she is. I then said I was suing them for the harassment, fake fines, and attempted lien on my property, and my destroyed trash can if I could prove it. I'd see them in court to take them for everything I could, because they were royally effed! Their faces all seemed to get flushed, save for Whale. She was puffy and red like a ripe tomato. I was then politely asked to leave so they could deliberate.

Not long after that, things came to an abrupt halt. Only a few days after I'd went to see the HOA board, President Whale was found dead in her home from a fatal heart attack. Apparently it had been brought on by stress and binge eating because the board had refused to stand by her, and voted to dismiss her as HOA president after I told them I was suing. I heard she had a full on child tantrum. I only wish I'd still been there to see it. Apparently she begged them to reconsider, and they packed her things for her and made her leave sobbing. She went home, and then died on her couch while binge eating cake. She lived alone, so nobody found her for days. And the morgue had a hell of a time getting her remains out of the house. She was in her mid sixties and morbidly obese with a serious junk food addiction. So she was basically one twinkie away from kicking the bucket at any time.

My lawsuit against the HOA ended when they agreed to settle out of court after Whale's death. They basically blamed everything on her. They claimed the fines and false lien were only her doing. Though I still don't really believe that. But the board wormed out of any serious consequences since it was Whale's name on all the paperwork. In the settlement the HOA paid all my legal fees, repaid the cost of my having to get CCTV cameras installed, and gave me a few thousand dollars on top of all that as a show of good faith. But Whale's family decided they were gonna come after both me and the HOA. They tried to sue both me and them for causing Whale's death. But the judge threw both cases out before they even went to court. I ended up getting a few anonymous threatening letters taped to my gate talking about things like breaking my legs. And the houses of each HOA board member got vandalized too. My mailbox was also ripped up out of the ground in the middle of the night. Joke was on them. I get all of my mail through a PO Box. Sadly I didn't have a camera at the end of the driveway to see who did it. I'd previously tried putting a trail cam there, but passing cars set it off all day and night. So I removed it.

The mailbox was only really there as an address marker anyway. And wasn't hard for me to replace. But tampering with a mailbox, even one that's basically just for display, is a federal offense. It couldn't be proven it was Whale's family that did it, as there were no cameras or witnesses that saw anything, and my mailbox was never found. But Whale's family vandalizing of the HOA board members' houses were all provable as there were cameras there, and those idiots didn't bother to cover their faces when they did all that damage. Some arrests were made, and a lot of restraining orders were filed. Whale's family finally sold her house and left. Guess they weren't stupid enough to go against a restraining order. I just replaced my display mailbox with one from Home Depot, and that's pretty much where the entire mess ends for me.

The whole situation was too much for the HOA though. And the residents passed a motion to shut it down completely. The HOA served no real function for comfort as there were no paid for common areas like a park or a pool. All meetings were held at the house of one of the board members, which as I said used to be a small school. There were accusations of repeated election rigging, as the board had remained the same for a long time, despite the fact they were so hated. And there were threats of an audit too. The board didn't fight the shut-down because they were all on the verge of being removed by force, so they were ready to throw in the towel. A couple of them even moved away. One of which I heard said that I had ruined everything, and the neighborhood was going to hell without the HOA. The former board were all retired busybodies anyway. The only one that's any semblance of liked, is the one who's house used to be a school and the HOA meeting building. They opened the gym room so locals could come in and play basketball on the regular. Their kids love it especially. I've been living peacefully here ever since, and I have actually made some friends. I didn't intend to. But I stopped to talk with neighbors a few times while out riding my bike, and it just went on from there. I've even been invited to a few barbecues and even a birthday party. Life is good.

TLDR: HOA harassed me for months to join. Obese woman-child president tried to fine me for anything she could think of, and even put a lien on my property. And she blocked my driveway by claiming she was landlocking me in. I sued the HOA, the HOA fired the president, the former president died from a heart attack caused by binge eating, then her family went on a revenge rampage, and then the HOA soon disbanded because they likely rigged elections and were threatened with an audit.

"Yesterday I started binge eating but for the first time in my life I had a thought that said : ""You don't have to keep eating, getting up and whashing your hair would also be nice."" So I did just that and did not resume eating afterwards !",And today I realised that this is big for me so I wanted to share !,1kh1s7m,n/a,2025-05-07 16:31:52
"In April of '19, we lost our youngest son. Sent me into a spiral of depression and binge eating. That June, I decided to use his death as motivation to change. I lost 150lb and gained self respect. I used to weight 340lb and dropped to 190lb.","I won't go into crazy detail unless people want.

Lost our son, it devastated me. Used that event to spur motivation to change my life, since I wanted to be around for our oldest son. 340lb at 30 years old doesn't lead itself to a long life.

Lost the weight, built some muscle, ran a 5k, changed my life.

EDIT:

Since people asked. My son was born April 1st in 2019. His name is Weylin. At birth, he was strong and healthy with no concerns. However, my wife tested positive for Strep Group B, so they had her on antibiotics at the time of delivery.

Three weeks into his life, he wasn't feeding. He would cry softly, and not eat. He eventually started keeping his eyes closed and go limp. 

We rushed him to urgent care, and his BP and temp were low. They did a series of tests and found that he has a bacterial infection in his brain caused by the SGB. Ultimately, it traveled to his brain stem, and we had to decide to take him off life support.

This devasted me. More than I knew possible. While I never had suicidal thoughts, had it continued, it likely could have gotten there. I remember vividly my wife and I trying to keep a brave face for our oldest (at the time 2). He didn't know where his brother went, but he would see us sad.

My weight ballooned more than it ever had. I just kept eating. I didn't know whether out of grief or what, but either way, I was constantly binging and just feeling terrible. One night, I had just finished my Toppers medium pizza, my wife's half of her pizza, and 14 chicken wings, and I broke down about how miserable I was.

I decided to make the change and get my life under control. I wouldn't be around much longer if I let things continue as they did. I redownloaded MyFitness Pal, deleted all my history, got my TDEE (total daily energy expenditure - maintenance calories) from tdeecalculator.net and started fresh. Just counting calories and eating 1000 calories less than my maintenance every day.

A year later, I had lost 150lb, I started working on gaining muscle, I ran a 5k, and my life has been 1000% better ever since. I have confidence back and my wife and I just welcomed our third child Fynnigan into our lives.

Hopefully Final Update on Am I the Asshole if I Don't Serve as Much Food as My Guests Want?,"First off, thanks to everyone who responded kindly. I'm still working through all the private messages, and I'll get there. Also, I'm still working on remembering the whole lasagna recipe. I'll post it when I do.

First, an apology. I knew Polly didn't use Reddit, but I was foolish and didn't think that Melissa might. I was out of line with some of what I said, like calling it a live mukbang show, and for that I apologize. This post was not supposed to be about fat-shaming, and I did, in my comments, fat-shame. That is on me, and I apologize. I do not hate Melissa for being obese. My problem has solely been about the etiquette and fairness of the food consumption and the stress it puts on me to see someone binge-eat so severely when I battle that disorder.

Update...  
That day they came to my house, I did eventually speak to Melissa and Polly after they calmed down. Melissa has always dreamed of having friends who would accept her as she is and be in a group where she can eat the way she does without judgment. Polly believed that I would provide that. I told them that I cannot, because I almost ate myself to death, and helping someone else do it is too much. Also, most of my other guests were uncomfortable. I said I would provide double portions to Melissa (which is a LOT of food), but no more. I did not mention the cost, because I didn't want them to offer to pay as a way around it.

They said they'd think about it, but Polly messaged me a few days later and said that she could not forgive me humiliating her partner online unless I showed true remorse by ""giving Melissa what she needs"" (an unlimited buffet at my home). So our friendship is over. Another member of the group has sided with Polly, upset at the fact that I discussed this online.

So that is where we're at. My group has shrunk. We'll grow again; there are a few people we are going to discuss who might make good additions. But we skipped this month's party because of the stress and drama.

As to whether I should have discussed it online at all... I've decided that I'm not sorry for that. I changed enough details that someone outside the circle would not recognize it. Some genders, names, ages, medical conditions, who has what career, which relatives I live with, who has what career, have been altered to preserve anonymity. I needed advice, and I thought anonymously online would be better than asking a bunch of people I knew, because I did not want to tell people who knew Melissa what happened.

Edited to add... I remember now that Melissa did go to the bathroom I think twice during the meal. I'm wondering if she purged in those trips. That would make it easier to consume that much food.",1ixi4ix,n/a,2025-02-25 00:45:39
Anybody struggle with binge eating once you’ve stopped drinking?,"I have just recently made the choice to not drink and i’m close to a week sober after 5 years of drinking beers heavily daily. i’ve kept active during my time drinking, running 4-6 miles 4-5 days a week and weight lifting 3-4 days a week. so i didn’t gain much weight. however, since i’ve stopped i have noticed an increase in my food intake and i just can’t stop eating… is this normal? if so what did you do to try and slow it down?

I've traded in binge drinking for binge eating.,"Hello my friends;

First and foremost I am 174 days alcohol free today and feeling reasonably good about that. I've been doing my best to count calories, work out 3-5 times a week, walk more, and by all accounts it's been going fairly well. I've even managed to lose some weight.

HOWEVER.

I find that after 5 to 6 days of adhering to my diet, I get an absolutely unreal craving for sugar, or just food in general. But mostly sugar. 

I'm talking driving 10 - 15 minutes down the road at 9:30pm to get an enormous ice cream cone before the shop closes, smashing that, then driving another 10 minutes to the grocery store to get a gross amount of sweets and snacks and absolutely gorging myself on the stuff, sometimes as soon as I get in the car. 

I eat, and eat, and eat, until by the end of the night I feel like garbage and think of myself as garbage. 

I've heard that sugar cravings can have a correlation to dehydration and have tried to stay on top of that, but it's so hard sometimes. Just like when I was drinking, I find that it's so difficult to over come the compulsion, even when in the same breath I know I'm not doing myself any favors. 

I am looking for advice, encouragement, or personal experiences any of you have had with this issue. 

TL;DR: I've been doing well without alcohol but have started bingeing food once or twice a week and it's ruining my gains/weight loss. Tell me how you deal with it.

Anyone here have serious binge eating or over eating issues?,"If so, how does it happen? Is it from stress, boredom, tiredness etc. I am curious because I have had this problem for a while and it’s one of the reasons I want to get medicated after I get assessed. It often happens out of boredom and it’s a lot of snacking. Sometimes I don’t realize I’m eating until a few seconds and I eat random things. I was eating sugar earlier because I was bored then my mom looks at me and asks me why I’m eating small bites of sugar . I also have lots of eating disorder history but even before that it all started with overeating which lead to me having an eating disorder and starving to lose weight then years later gaining half of it back. What is the correlation ?",rq1yym,n/a,2021-12-28 00:39:22
Every and any tip you can give me to quit binge eating even if it’s something completely ridiculous,"Hey ya’ll it’s me again 😎 

Please do not look at my profile if you’re easily annoyed by people constantly crying and complaining and then not doing anything about it. But dear fucking Lord I want to do something about it so badly but this switch just will not flip for me to have even an ounce of motivation. 

If you do look at my previous posts, I’m currently on a waitlist to be assessed for ADHD. Even if it’s determined I do have it, it’s another 7 months on a waitlist for medication. Well if I don’t get a handle on my binge eating in the mean time I’ll be dead before I ever even get assessed. 

I binge nearly every day. I hate the way I look, I feel ashamed, I was never flexible but I’m noticing I’m getting less flexible. 

So please give me anything for me to try, anything to try and get my motivation going because apparently hating myself isn’t enough

"My wife [34F] is spiraling and I [36M] am tired of covering for her. I need her to get her weight under control, but we've been down this road before and it always eventually falls apart. How can I help her see I'm serious and salvage this?","Before I get started, I want to make one thing clear: I love my wife. She's the mother of my two children, she's intelligent and funny, and I have always been and remain attracted to her. She's always been heavier since we first met, and I've never had a problem with that except insofar as it effects our family's quality of life, as I'll explain below.

For some background, we have been married for nine years and she has steadily gained weight over the course of our marriage. This was particularly exacerbated by a difficult pregnancy, which was immediately followed by the COVID lockdowns and her losing her long-term job. Things continued to get out of hand until early last year, when some incidents finally convinced her to see a doctor and get control of things. Her weight was well over 500 lbs, and her doctor prescribed her Zepbound and recommended she start seeing a therapist. This worked fairly well for a while, (though she almost immediately quit therapy), and by the end of last summer she had lost over 20 lbs. She had also generally improved her outlook, gotten a part-time job, and was much more active. We loved taking walks together.

Things took a turn for the worse in two ways last fall: first, my job switched insurance plans to one that didn't cover glp-1s for weight loss, and second, a family member passed away pretty suddenly, which caused her a lot of grief and stress. She was home from work for about a month on bereavement after the passing, and at the same time her binge eating, which had been suppressed by Zepbound, returned with a fury. This bled into the Holidays, which are obviously not good for anyone's waistline, and this year she's basically fallen back into all of her old habits. I don't know her current weight, but she's definitely gained back everything she lost plus some.

Here's where the advice portion starts: I've had to start adjusting my life in a lot of ways to accommodate her limitations, and the list grows longer every week. While by no means exhaustive, the list includes:

* She is unable to put on socks or shoes or trim her toenails on her own.
* Always needs my help getting up from our sofa, which is pretty low, or from playing with the kids on the floor
* I have to drive her to work and the kids to school despite working from home myself, because she is too big to safely fit behind the wheel
* When friends invite us out, I have to make excuses to cancel plans and lie to them to avoid admitting things like, ""no we can't come because she can't stand up for that long"". Our social life is in the tank
* Our romantic life sucks. Basically all dates are staying in to get takeout and watch a movie, because she gets anxious about restaurants, can't fit in movie theaters, and can't do most things that involve physical activity
* Most weekdays when she isn't working she barely leaves bed, leaving me to work full-time and do all of the child-care at the same time once they're home from school.
* Grocery shopping is a nightmare because she can't really stay standing for long enough, but is too proud to use one of the store scooters, so she stays in the car and calls me on my air-pods and tells me what to get. And if I refuse her anything, suddenly I'm being manipulative or insulting her weight. The whole thing makes me feel like a drug dealer or something.

Every week on Sunday she basically hypes herself up about how this will be the week to turn everything around, but then she never changes anything. And if I remind her of what she said and try to curb her eating choices I'm ""not being helpful"". I'm honestly getting really sick of all this and feel close to snapping. To top everything off, my job was partially funded by federal grant money, so as of two weeks ago I'm unemployed and looking for work. I can't handle everything that I'm being asked to do and the stress is killing me to the point I frequently fantasize about running away, just booking a plane ticket and leaving her to deal with things for a weekend. I would never actually do that, but it makes me feel like a terrible husband and father to even have those thoughts. I feel like I'm living in a loop of broken promises and plans every week and I don't know how to get it to stick. Obviously I will be heavily considering the health insurance plan for wherever I look into working next, as glp-1s have been the only thing to really help so far.

How can I show her how much I'm hurting without looking shallow or selfish? How can I get one of her diet attempts to stick while we wait for another opportunity to get on drugs? For the foreseeable future I'm going to have to keep doing extra, because she can't physically help right now with a lot of things, but I need a plan and an end in sight or I'm gonna go nuts.",1jcsizd,n/a,2025-03-16 18:46:54
Made it a week without binge eating!,"I met my goal weight around February and have been maintaining since then. I'd done pretty well when I was at school, but moving back home because of COVID has been causing me to struggle. I eventually figured out that IF eating from 3-8pm works for me, but in that window I've still been eating too much.

 The week before last I binge ate pretty badly, gained 2 pounds in 5 days, and felt absolutely horrible and out of control. I cried at my desk for an hour, then on Thursday of last week I decided I was going to make my goal just not binging for a week, not trying to loose or maintain my weight, but just stopping when I feel full.  And I did it! 7 days today without binging. I had a couple spots where I ate a little more than I should have, and I let myself stress eat outside of my time limit once, but I stopped myself from going too far. I held on to my control, didn't punish myself for failing, and told myself that messing up didn't mean I had to keep eating. I could still stop, it wouldn't hurt me and I wasn't a bad person for going over a little.

I didn't count calories, but I did notice that there were several trigger foods that had caused me to go on binges before, and I cut 5 of those out completely for the week- cookies, cake, chips, chocolate, and cereal. I have no idea why they all start with C lol, but it checks out- I have trouble with cinnamon bread, candy, and coconut bars too. I wrote down my '5Cs' on my arm every morning to help keep myself in check. 

This morning I weighed myself after not looking all week- I didn't loose any of the weight I'd gained before when I was binging, but I'm reminding myself that that wasn't my goal, self control was. I'm not sure what my goal for this week will be. I'm thinking  about removing one of the Cs from my list and trying to see if I can incorporate it back into my diet and still not binge. I'm really hopeful that if I can work on managing my self control now it'll mean in the long run it won't be so much mental work to keep my healthy weight, it'll be automatic.",g2hzvs,n/a,2020-04-16 16:17:50

"2 Years' Progress (140lbs->117->128): binge eating, to running, to lifting on a vegan diet (Female, 5""6)","So I'm posting this partially out of tradition, as I posted my progress a year ago today and wanted to update. 

So two years ago, February 2015 (age 19), I looked like this:
http://imgur.com/TaBGbhL

Coming out of a nasty breakup and a year alone at a uni I hated, I was winding down from an episode of binge eating and a completely sedentary lifestyle. I didn't count calories at all but looking back, I think I could say I was putting away around 5,000 calories a day on some days. I barely left bed, and chronic insomnia meant I fell asleep at 6am and woke at 4pm most days, getting little to no sunlight throughout the winter. After slowly taking steps to get my life back on track, my body was my next big project. 

I started running- only 2km once a week at first, then twice a week, and by August 2015 I was doing 10km four times a week. I counted calories, cut down to about 1,400, and by the time February 2016 rolled round I was at 117lbs, having gone from a UK size 12 to a size 6 (age 20):
http://imgur.com/WjGs0Ue

I went vegan on the first day of 2016, and noticed a massive difference in my recovery time and my energy. I swapped out my 4 runs for 3 lifting sessions and 1 run a week, and loved it. However, at 117lbs I wasn't eating anywhere near as much as I wanted to be able to, and I disliked feeling... small. So I decided to slowly bulk my way up again. I started at about 1,900 calories, and it did... nothing. I increased bit by bit (I was afraid of suddenly putting on a ton of fat, so I was far too careful), and eventually found that my sweet spot for gaining 0.5lbs a week was at an unexpected 2,350 calories a day, at a 50:30:20 (C,F,P) Macro split. I've stuck with that since about August time, and I'm finally here, at 128lbs (age 21):

Am I where I want to be yet? No, I intend to bulk up to 135lbs and then cut over the summer, because right now I feel a bit soft on the exterior. But I'm happy with what my body can do, and the wonders that getting in shape have done for my physical and mental health, allowing me to manage my sleep disorders, IBS and anxiety far better than I ever did. I'm excited about what the next year holds. :)",5vq8yo,n/a,2017-02-23 13:01:38

It is amazing how strong the desire to stress eat is,"Yesterday, I had significant conflict with a loved one that lead to some intense emotions.  While we worked through a lot of it (in a respectful way), I was still left emotionally drained and I was pretty surprised at how strong my desire was to stress eat.

I believe that like a lot of people I was overweight for multiple reasons.  I think for me it was a learned lifestyle that I chose to maintain, a form of entertainment and a way I managed stress.  So yesterday, I was 100% cognitively aware what was going on.   I knew that I was physically full and my desire to reach for boxes of carby food (Cheez its, Life cereal, pretzels) was for emotional comfort.  It was how I really wanted to self soothe.  I also know that the world won't end if I slip up.  That if I did comfort eat my preferred starchy food that I would have a bad day and get back on track the next day.   I also knew the relief that I felt while eating would be momentary at best.  I knew that I would end up bloated and unhappy.  Ultimately, I knew I would still feel sad and be drained from the earlier conflict.  So, I didn't eat but let me tell you, the desire to eat was so, so strong.",mgedt1,n/a,2021-03-30 12:01:52

I've found myself a neat little life hack to deal with emotional eating,"Hello fellow redditors,

I've accidentally stumbled upon a neat little life hack, and I wondered if other people do it too.

I struggle a lot with emotional eating/stress eating, and this past month I've been trying to replace it with healthier coping mechanisms. One thing that's helped me a lot is to treat each instance when I'm overwhelmed/stressed like a practise run. Like - oh, I could use this chance to go out for a walk, and see if that helps. Or I'll think of one of the healthier alternatives I came up with earlier and try it out - and actually be able to see if it works for me or not.

&#x200B;

I think it's the ""getting outside the problem"" that helps me - instead of marinating in my misery, it changes the perspective of my emotional state.

&#x200B;

Dunno if this'll help anyone, but just wanted to share.

AITAH for installing a lock on my fridge to stop my roommate from ‘stress-eating’ my food?,"So, I (30F) live with my roommate, Sarah (29F), who has this habit of eating everything in the fridge, whether it’s hers or not. She always says it’s because she’s “stressed” and swears she’ll replace it, but my groceries vanish faster than a dating app match after mentioning kids. The last straw was when she ate my emotional support tiramisu. For context, I’d spent hours making this tiramisu after a rough week at work. It was my therapy in a dessert.

Sarah ate the whole thing without asking and left a note on the empty dish that said, “Sorry! PMS sucks. I owe you.” That was it. I lost it. I ordered a lock for the fridge for my food and moved everything into it. Now Sarah’s furious, saying I’ve “ruined the vibe of the apartment” and that I’m “passive-aggressive” for locking her out of the shared fridge. She even tried to rally our other roommates against me (spoiler: they also hide their snacks from her).

AITAH for locking up my food, or is Sarah just mad she can’t steal my serotonin anymore?

UPDATE(S) - 12/22
- There is a TEMPORARY lock on the fridge while we figure out a solution. 
- We have no proof to go to the cops, we have receipts from the last 6 months of grocery bills and she claims that she could have been on those grocery runs. She also took the broken lock from my roommate. 
- We’ve lived with Sarah for around 6 years now , she was one of the core girls in our group and this has only started within the last 14 months. So we care about her as a person but this behavior can’t continue. She only recently started saying it’s because we make more money than her and that it’s only fair we share since we’ve been friends for so long. 
- We’ve gone to the landlord for theft, he claims that we just need to work it out and don’t really have a leg to stand on. We also use a paying portal with him where we automatically split the rent four ways. 
- As for buying a fridge , we already bought two 400 dollar coolers and that still didn’t work. Why should we pay an additional few hundred for a fridge and our electric bills would be insane. 
- We CANNOT break the lease. We would loose our 4,800 security deposit and need to pay 9.8k for 60 days of rent until they find new tenants (& we can’t live there during the 60 days)
- Her parents are crazy strict and abusive and feel bad for going to her parents.

"I hope non-positive posts are allowed here. I've been really struggling with stress eating, lack of willpower, and depression for almost 3 years.","I am having a really hard time and feel more and more hopeless as more time goes by and my efforts at turning things around continue to fail. I struggled with weight most of my adult life until around 4 years ago when I began doing strict CICO and got down to 119 lbs, which is still a little on ""thicker"" side given how short I am, but I was for the first time ever feeling good in clothes and confident in my ability to finally achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Then I began medical school, some very stressful circumstances occurred in my family life around the same time, and I fell into stress eating. Something takes over when I am studying for an exam that I am stressed out of my mind about, and I turn into some kind of binge-eating monster who cannot chill out and focus until she's stuffed her face with every last junk food that stress is making her crave. On top of that, there is so much free food available in medical school, but it's rarely anything healthy or at least low-calorie, so I'm stuck in a constant no-win situation where I'm either riddled with guilt because I spent money I don't really have on a salad or, alternatively, because I ate the free pizza at the hospital to save the money.

I'm just stuck in a complete rut and feeling levels of self hatred and disgust that make me never want to leave my bed again, and I don't know what to do. I don't know what weight I'm up to now because I stopped weighing myself when I realized that it only ever upset me and never motivated me to finally get my act together, but I wouldn't be surprised if I was up to 150 by now. I'd like to start regular therapy to see if that did anything at all for me since the antidepressant I'm on isn't helping, but my clinical rotation schedule unfortunately makes it virtually impossible to make happen. I don't even know what the purpose of this post is other than venting some of my sadness and frustration. I graduate in about a year and really hope I can figure out a way to not be fat by then.",lqx48f,n/a,2021-02-23 23:53:36
I don't think the majority of men actually care about women,"I am appalled, I came across a discussion where the man posted if he should leave his partner because she gained 20-25 pounds. He claims to love her and then says ""It’s about her attitude change, **why doesn’t she care to look good for me anymore ?**""

That was so shocking and EYE OPENING to me, I feel like we are seen as accessories to their lives, they do not see us out own self and only how things effect them. **If my partner put on rapid weight, my first concern would be if they have a medical issue and to have them checked out instead of jumping to the conclusion they do not care to look good for me and wondering if I should leave them...**

It could have also been a mental health issue, stress eating, etc. or perhaps she is even pregnant, but nope I am surprised some men never consider any of those other factors and just ""she doesn't care to look good for me anymore"".",1i3p4fw,n/a,2025-01-17 19:54:43

The Worst Wedding I've Ever Attended,"After recently discovering this sub and reading the stories, I wanted to share my own tale.  This happened 25 years ago, but so many of the details are burned in my brain.  Sorry for it being so long, but this was a mess (before, during, and after the wedding).

I was a groomsman for two friends getting married (or, rather, I was friends with Bride and friendly acquaintances with Groom).  Both were 20 years old, but were from evangelical families who pushed young marriage so they could start having children right away (think the Duggars without the TV deal or as many kids).  They met at church, where Groom's father was the pastor, and dated less than six months before they were engaged.  They were then married less than six months after that.

Some of the details I remember from being a part of this clusterfuck of both the wedding and the lead-up to it...

* Bride had spent years telling our entire friend group that she was going to be a virgin when she got married.  Even a month before the wedding, she was lording her virginity over the heads of our non-married, non-virgin, female friends.  That, alone, caused a lot of hurt feelings and fights.  I didn't find out about any of this, though, until well after the wedding.

* Two weeks before the wedding, Bride suddenly stopped proudly proclaiming her virginity.  No one knew why until *the day of the wedding* when Bride broke down in tears while getting dressed.  As was relayed to me by a bridesmaid, Bride was terrified she was pregnant and that her marriage wasn't sacred anymore.  Did Bride and Groom have sex before the wedding?!  Nope.  She had given him a handjob in his car, during which he finished on himself and not on her.  She was so woefully naïve about sex that she thought simply getting a man's semen on her hand would get her pregnant.  To make matters more awkward, she refused to believe the bridesmaids when they told her pregnancy doesn't work that way.  She only calmed down when she told the story *to Groom's mother*, who promptly had a ""birds and bees"" talk with her soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

Now, onto the wedding itself...

* Due to the stress of planning the wedding and trying to navigate the expectations of her *HIGHLY* conservative, traditional, ""women should be seen and not heard"" future husband, Bride had put on quite a bit of weight from stress-eating.  I am not shaming her for that *at all*.  The problem was that she had done her dress fitting almost four months before the wedding.  When Bride's mother tried to convince her to go back in for a new fitting to account for her new size, Bride refused.  She swore up and down that she hadn't gained weight, despite half of her wardrobe no longer fitting her.  She picked up the dress a week before the wedding, but refused to try it on.  Again, she swore it would fit.  She finally tried it on the day before the wedding and had a panic attack that it didn't zip up anymore.  Her mother, a sweet and wonderful woman, stayed up until nearly dawn sewing panels into the side of the dress to make sure it would fit Bride.  Was Bride thankful for her mother's efforts?  Nope.  She bitched and moaned that the panels weren't the exact same shade of white as the rest of the dress.

* Bride's older brother (the black sheep of the devout family) brought his on-again, off-again girlfriend to the wedding.  She wore a dress that was probably two sizes too small along with *no* underwear.  We know that because, during a dance with the older brother, she interrupted her grinding on his crotch to bend over and shove her ass against him.  The promptly ripped her dress along the seam (which was on the back).  She didn't notice, apparently, because she stood up, turned around to continue grinding him, and flashed her bare ass...and more during subsequent dance moves...to the entire reception.

* I was one of two gay guys at the wedding, the other being a long-time friend (and fellow groomsman).  Groom knew we were both gay, but didn't tell his family.  Someone, though, spilled the beans to Groom's fire-and-brimstone preacher of a father.  During a slow dance, for which my friend and I were sitting at a table talking quietly, Groom's father came over and practically threatened to kill us if we danced together at the reception.  We had no intentions of dancing together.  We, from the day we met, have had zero sexual or romantic attraction to one another.  We are friends, that's all.  But, the idea of two men possibly dancing together in public sent Groom's father off the deep end.

* Groom's younger brother (14 or 15 at the time) snuck a bottle of wine away from the bar and was found drunk, puking his guts out, in the grass behind the venue.  Of course, fire-and-brimstone preacher didn't care.  He was too busy giving the side-eye to me and my gay friend for the rest of the night.

* When the party was over, Bride and Groom went to leave.  Written on the back of Groom's car wasn't ""Just Married"" or something like that.  Instead, Bride's two brothers had written ""Free to Fuck.""  Bride cried, Groom laughed and refused to wash it off.

* A few months after the wedding, I had lunch with Bride at her request.  After lunch, as I was dropping her back off and her and Groom's apartment, she told me that this would be the last time we'd speak to each other as Groom had forbidden her from having male friends, especially *gay* male friends.  When I tried to question why she was turning her back on me now after years of friendship (we met in middle school), she just said ""Groom is my husband and he is in charge.  I cannot disobey him.""

Like I said, that was 25 years ago.  True to her word (and to my own desires after that lunch), she and I have never spoken again.  In fact, no one in the friend group (who were all groomsmen and bridesmaids) spoke to either of them again.  Groom insisted that Bride cut off all men and non-virtuous (i.e. virgin and evangelical) women from her life.  Bride, like the ""proper"" evangelical wife she was, did exactly as she was ordered.",1mcgpef,n/a,2025-07-29 16:51:04
AITA for yelling at my mom because she ate the food that I bought with my money?,"
Our fridge is usually close to empty. There’s always condiments, eggs and some sort of shredded cheese but that’s it. Usually cream for coffee too which I sometimes use for cereal. The pantry is full of dried pasta, Cheerios and granola bars that are strictly for my sister. My dad locks away all of the good food for himself and wears the key around his neck like fucking Zoey101.  So there’s nothing to really make besides scrambled eggs, cereal or pasta. Yeah I should be grateful that there’s food at all but I’m sorry I can’t just live off of those things. Plus I have a really sensitive stomach so a lot of dairy and gluten will destroy my stomach.

 Yesterday, I bought my own food and left it in the fridge. Starved myself all day for as long as possible so I could eat towards the end of the day to not go to bed hungry. I got a big enough meal to eat half last night and half tonight. I don’t make enough money to buy solid meals for myself all the time so I was really looking forward to not eating the same old thing yet again. I opened the fridge today when I was hungry to the point of vomiting and the majority of my food was gone. Maybe a bite or two left but nothing I could actually get full off of. So naturally I got pissed because I’m starving, I paid for it with the little money I have in the first place and my mom didn’t even ask. So I walked into her (home) office and asked her if she ate my food. Her argument was that she thought it was old from days ago when she literally knows I came home with it last night. I even got her something too which she ate for dinner last night!!!!Then I got even more mad saying I’m starving and haven’t eaten anything in over 24 hours. She started bawling her eyes out and my dad started screaming at me for being over dramatic. Then she dramatically left the house saying she’s gonna blow off work for the rest of the day to go and get me the same meal. My dad ran out and took the keys from her before she could leave then came inside saying she’s crying. 

So not only did she eat my food, she guilt tripped me and made me feel like I’m the reason why she’s not gonna make any money today. Because she ate my food that I starved myself for. I think I feel extra guilty because we get along well but this isn’t the first time it’s happened. When I told my sister she sighed and rolled her eyes because this has happened to her too with the same excuse. All I know is that I’m mad, feel guilty and have extremely low blood sugar so I might just sleep it off or something. Am I the asshole for reacting the way I did? 

Edit:
For tiktok Reddit accounts pls don’t use this story my family lives on tiktok and it’d be bad for me. 

Edit 2: For everyone asking, I’m an adult and my sister is an adult so there’s no need for CPS. We’re both starting out college at two kinda local universities and we’re still at home because we live in an expensive area so it would be really hard to move out considering I make less than minimum wage and rely on tips while she’s too busy to have a job at all. 

My mother and I are pretty close but she’s really stressed out and anxious so I think she has some sort of stress eating issue or something. She’s really checked out from constantly working. I’m not gonna call anyone on her or my dad because we don’t snitch on our family. I don’t know how else to put it when it comes to that. Especially legal authorities. My dad is another story. A really stressful, gut wrenching awful story that I don’t have time to unpack. 

I would like to thank everyone for showing concern and kindness towards me. I really do appreciate it. I’m currently saving up to transfer to a school in Europe. Then maybe just stay there. I’m sad to leave my sister but she said she plans on joining me there too as soon as she can. ",1ccambx,n/a,2024-04-24 21:46:26

*February 18, 2025*

First, I want to be clear that I do not believe in body-shaming or food policing. Having lost 100 lbs myself and working on another 50,, I have no place to judge anyone for what they eat. I pride myself on being a generous host who makes my guests comfortable and feeds them well. Nobody leaves my house hungry has always been my rule.

The problem:
I have a friend group who meets monthly at either my or ""Joan's"" home for dinner (nobody else has enough space to host). Recently, ""Polly"" announced she had a girlfriend, which made us all happy. Polly has been lonely for a long time.

I was the first to host ""Melissa."" Melissa is 500-600 lbs. I've never met anyone that big, but I hid my surprise and was warm and welcoming. No problem; I have sturdy furniture.

For dinner, I served bowls of salad, then soup. Melissa insisted on keeping her empty bowls at the table. I didn't think much of it; I'm not Emily Post. Then I brought out the main course, two 9X13 pans of 14-layer lasagna, cut into 8 pieces each. There were 10 of us altogether. I told people to dig in as I got the bread out of the oven. When I got back to the dining room, everyone looked so shocked I thought my cat had farted (his mouse farts could suffocate an elephant). Then I saw that Melissa had four pieces of lasagna heaped on her plate, two in her salad bowl, and two in her soup bowl. Polly was glaring like ""don't you dare say a word."" Melissa seemed utterly oblivious. I didn't know what to do. I just sat down.

Joan and I shared one piece of lasagna, and everyone else got a full piece. I cut the cake into equal portions for dessert, but I had to make an extra batch of sauce and get an extra tub of ice cream out. Melissa ate at least a litre.

The next month, on Joan's turn, she served every course pre-plated, and when Melissa asked for extra, Joan apologized and said there was none (truth; Joan is very organized and precise). Melissa and Polly left right after dinner, and Polly texted Joan, berating her for ""controlling"" Melissa's eating. Polly also texted me saying she trusted I'd be sensitive to Melissa's needs on my next turn.

That turn is almost here. My plan was roast dinner (pork and beef). I can easily make lots of cheap veg and dessert, but meat is pricey right now, and I'd have to serve twice the norm to satisfy Melissa. I know I cannot just trust she'll take a tenth of what's there, considering she grabbed a whole lasagna last time.. So do I suck it up and just buy much larger roasts? Do I make a few big batches of cheap soup and biscuits and serve that rather than strain my budget? I don't want to upset Melissa or be a stingy host, but I have never dealt with someone like this before. I was obese, but I would have eaten maybe 2 pieces of lasagna. Not 8. Do I just serve a reasonable-sized meal and tell Polly and Melissa ""sorry, that's all I have""?

AITAH if I serve less food than I know my guests will want?

Edited to add... everyone in the group who doesn't cook (so 7 people before Melissa joined) chips in $25 per meal to whoever hosts. That, until inflation got so bad, covered enough of the food cost to make it feasible. Joan and I have both been simplifying our menus a bit to deal with rising costs, but the idea is to give ourselves and our friends a night off from the humdrum world and pretend we live glamorous, elegant lives. We use fine china and dress nicely and play classical music. Right before Melissa, I was going to ask if we could increase the chip-in to $30 a plate. I have the most resources out of anyone in the group, and I can afford to go out-of-pocket a bit more than Joan. None of the rest have the money, space, or culinary skills to put this together. Joan and I can cook like Julia Child. We are a ragtag lot with a variety of neurodivergences and mental health issues. These meals give us something special to look forward to.

Consensus: NTA. Commenters say it's not about Melissa's weight, it's about her not having any damn manners.

*February 19, 2025, 1 day later*

Excrement is hitting the fan right now. I thought I was safe because I knew Polly didn't use Reddit. But apparently Melissa told an online friend about 14-layer lasagna, and that friend saw the post and showed it to her. Stupid me, wanting to show off my culinary prowess! Apparently I'm not the only one this has happened to. I was silly to think ""Oh, it couldn't happen to me!""

So, Melissa and Polly are at my house now, enraged, and my dad the semi-retired crisis counsellor is talking to them whilst I wait downstairs in my suite and cry. Yes, I am hiding behind my parents, but they are calmer and more objective, and I am too anxious have a rational conversation with Polly and Melissa.

Update:, it sounds like they've split them off. Dad is in one room talking to Melissa. Mum is in another, talking to Polly. I cannot get close enough to eavesdrop, and my damn cat won't tell me what he's hearing.

Might as well take this time to answer some common questions:

1. The chip-in has been $25 per person who doesn't cook. Joan and I never pay, regardless of who hosts. So we have been working off a budget of $175 because the group is nine people and seven pay. Last night and this morning we decided to increase the chip-in to $35. As of this moment, Melissa is only invited if she sticks to appropriate portions because no matter how much she pays, the rest of the group does not want to watch her eat like that. Is that mean? I don't know. But, given the yelling from upstairs, I don't know if she or Polly will ever return.
2. For those who think I cannot have sturdy enough furniture... my dad is a very large man. My now-deceased Opa and my uncle custom-built most of the furniture in the house, least the stuff he would sit on. Dad has lost a lot, but everyone in the family has a good chair or two for him to sit on in their homes.
3. Polly has helped me through a lot and has had a very difficult life, so I am loathe to upset her. I understand now that I need to grow a spine and that I don't need to be a doormat.
4. I built this group and started the parties in part because restaurants aren't an option for all involved. We have a plethora of metal, physical, and neurospicy health issues going on. One of us has dwarfism and doesn't like being stared at. The parties are our escape from difficult lives. We dress up in vintage glam costumes we've found at thrift stores or made for ourselves and pretend that we are in Golden Age Hollywood or something. It's a big deal, and both Joan and I truly love to cook and host.
5. I like cooking fancy food because I have to cook healthfully the rest of the time for my own weight loss and my diabetic parents. I do not want my parties to turn into salad and lentil fests. I eat that the rest of the time.
6. For whoever suggested a crawded boil... we are landlocked in Canada. Beef is cheaper than crawdads around here. I haven't cooked much Southern Soul food, but it's a possibility if we don't include seafood because it costs the Earth.
7. Polly sees Melissa's issues as a disability we should accommodate. She compared it to Dad building a wheelchair ramp onto the front porch for my granny and auntie. But I now understand that letting Melissa gorge is not a kindness. it's enabling very dangerous behaviour. She could keel over in my dining room, and we do not want to deal with all the paperwork that would create.
8. I honestly did think that everyone who was morbidly obese and addicted to food got that way from trauma because my sister and I did.
9. I wasn't actually deprived of lasagna. Joan and I often share a piece. I've had bariatric surgery and cannot eat much, and Joan prefers salad and bread and only a small portion of something as rich as lasagna.
10. I'll post the recipe once I remember all of it. It's a combo of a few different ones and some right from my head. I'm extremely stressed right now, so remembering ingredients isn't working.
11. I was wrong on Melissa's weight. She's 490 lbs. My bad; I am not good at estimating those things.
12. I would be much calmer right now and not be having chest pain if this was rage-bait. I wish it was rage-bait. Sorry to disappoint.
13. Please don't call Melissa derogatory names. This is not about hating on fat people. I was looking for advice on how to approach her obesity and food addiction behaviour with fairness and compassion.

Also, thanks for all the kind and helpful things people said. Some of the douchey ones gave me a laugh, like the eejit who thought two enormous lasagnas doesn't feed 10 people. I'll write another post when things are resolved.

*February 25, 2025, 1 week later*

First off, thanks to everyone who responded kindly. I'm still working through all the private messages, and I'll get there. Also, I'm still working on remembering the whole lasagna recipe. I'll post it when I do.

First, an apology. I knew Polly didn't use Reddit, but I was foolish and didn't think that Melissa might. I was out of line with some of what I said, like calling it a live mukbang show, and for that I apologize. This post was not supposed to be about fat-shaming, and I did, in my comments, fat-shame. That is on me, and I apologize. I do not hate Melissa for being obese. My problem has solely been about the etiquette and fairness of the food consumption and the stress it puts on me to see someone binge-eat so severely when I battle that disorder.

Update...
That day they came to my house, I did eventually speak to Melissa and Polly after they calmed down. Melissa has always dreamed of having friends who would accept her as she is and be in a group where she can eat the way she does without judgment. Polly believed that I would provide that. I told them that I cannot, because I almost ate myself to death, and helping someone else do it is too much. Also, most of my other guests were uncomfortable. I said I would provide double portions to Melissa (which is a LOT of food), but no more. I did not mention the cost, because I didn't want them to offer to pay as a way around it.

They said they'd think about it, but Polly messaged me a few days later and said that she could not forgive me humiliating her partner online unless I showed true remorse by ""giving Melissa what she needs"" (an unlimited buffet at my home). So our friendship is over. Another member of the group has sided with Polly, upset at the fact that I discussed this online.

So that is where we're at. My group has shrunk. We'll grow again; there are a few people we are going to discuss who might make good additions. But we skipped this month's party because of the stress and drama.

As to whether I should have discussed it online at all... I've decided that I'm not sorry for that. I changed enough details that someone outside the circle would not recognize it. Some genders, names, ages, medical conditions, who has what career, which relatives I live with, who has what career, have been altered to preserve anonymity. I needed advice, and I thought anonymously online would be better than asking a bunch of people I knew, because I did not want to tell people who knew Melissa what happened.

____

>#Comments by OOP:

- 

I never brought up the possibility of Melissa and Polly paying for the excess because I didn't want that to be a pathway to this happening again. Everyone who doesn't cook does chip in for food. It's possible that Melissa might have been willing to pay for what she ate.

It felt like.... she wanted to her wants to come first no matter the consequences. She wanted everyone to put their discomfort aside for her enjoyment, and that included me with my BED being triggered. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

- 

I said some pretty foul things in my comments on the first post, like ""live mukbang show."" I do understand why Polly wanted to end the friendship. That was very wrong of me, especially because I did NOT want to present this as hateful toward fat people. I wanted to present it with compassion and help people understand how horrific food addiction is so they'd have more empathy for those plagued with it.

Polly's demand wasn't so much about creating the unlimited buffet as it was prioritizing Melissa's wishes to eat all she wanted in spite of the discomfort of other guests and allowing my own food addiction issues to be triggered. I did explain to Polly about how much it triggered me, and I think the demand was deliberate in that I should put myself in such discomfort to atone. I was wrong for the rude things I said, but I won't put myself in that danger to atone. I've been stress-eating since it happened, worse since things blew up, and I need to get it under control.

- 

We didn't consent to it. I did not consider there could be a sexual component. I mean, I like sex, but I've never linked it with food beyond whipped cream and chocolate sauce, you know? And to me, sex is a private, two-person activity, not a spectator sport.

We skipped this month's party because of all the drama. Next month, I will do a roast dinner. Usually I like to serve numerous courses, but roast dinner kind of works better when it's served together, so the only starter will be a simple consomme or, if I have slightly wilting veggies, a pureed vegetable soup. I make consomme a few times a year and pressure-can it (I love to do everything possible from scratch), and it makes it easier for dealing with my parents' diabetes because I know what's in everything. I buy my meat from a local butcher who only works with a handful of farms that practise humane livestock raising, so I can custom-order the cuts I want. Yes, I know this is privilege because my family can afford it. We aren't taking European vacations or anything, but the food is good and we have a cleaner once a week. I'd be living on rice and beans if I had to buy my own food.

Two days before the meal, I'll stud the beef roast with rosemary and garlic and the pork with sprigs of thyme and thin slices of onion. I rub some sea salt, white pepper and garlic powder on the beef and sea salt, white pepper and sage powder on the pork. Let those sit, wrapped tightly in plastic, in the fridge, for two days before roasting. Just before roasting, I'll stud the pork with thin slices of apple (slide those in beside the onion). I'll put apple juice in with the pork and red wine in with the beef. During roasting, I turn each roast several times so all sides have a chance to sit in the liquid. I favour lean meats with little marbling, so I have to make extra effort to ensure they're moist and tender.

After the roasting, I'll make two different gravies, a beef one and a pork one. There will also be Yorkshire pudding, roasted carrots, applesauce, and a bacon/apple/brussel sprout dish. Roast dinner doesn't really serve well in courses, so we'll have a simple consomme soup starter and then straight to the main course, which we will likely eat very slowly. I keep the serving dishes covered so the food stays hot.

Then a break where everyone who is able helps clean up, and then we sit around and listen to music and chat, and eventually dessert, which will be sticky toffee pudding with whisky sauce and whipped cream.

If I do it right, I'll have leftover everything. Then the next day, my mother will make fried potato cakes for breakfast (parents get up earlier than me). And she'll eat the brussel sprouts during the day because she loves them. For supper, I'll chop the leftover meat and carrots and add some peas to make a simple stew (the gravies mix nicely) and my family will eat that with bread.

Sorry if that's more info than you wanted, but I hate food waste so I wanted to show how I cook deliberately to prevent it. There's a cookbook called More with Less that is really good for showing cheap, healthy ways to cook that also avoid waste.

- 

I didn't even offer them the option to pay for her excess. It's possible she might have agreed to do so, but I think part of the fantasy is someone else just providing the food and pretending like what she's doing is normal and socially acceptable.

- 

I've been deeply conflicted about all this because I understand the food addiction side of it and don't want to make anyone's struggle worse in that regard. I mean, I needed to grow a spine and realize I had to protect my own health before someone else's, and I'm glad for people who told me to do it. But grasping how far their manipulation went has made it easier to let go of the friendship.

- 

I think Polly is taking advantage of the fact that I don't want to upset someone for being obese and she told Melissa that I wouldn't object to her eating all she wanted. I think she sees me as a safe space for Melissa to live out her compulsions unopposed. Polly might have more of a manipulative side than I thought.

- 

Early 40s. Before you judge me for hiding behind my parents, remember that I have significant neurodivergence and mental health issues. I'm still in therapy to learn to manage confrontation and the like. I used to be a very mean person (that's how I coped with the anxiety), but I hated that and have worked so hard to go in the other direction that I went too far and break down during emotional confrontation. I'm still recovering from a very dangerous bout of depression and a hospitalisation. I don't want to go back there, so I'm doing what I must. Even if it's letting my dad fight my battles.

- 

They know where I live. They've been here before. I didn't invite them in. They knocked, the cleaner let them in and called for me, and they started yelling. Once my parents figured out what was happening, they suggested I go calm down. Overbearing or not, they're trying to protect me.

I thought I'd have a few days to figure this all out, but Melissa saw the Reddit post, and she recognized it. I hadn't changed many identifying details because I'd just been thinking about Polly not seeing it.

- 

I think that's what it is. Our city is not large, and I doubt there's an actual feeder community. So they're looking for people who will support them in their lifestyle, but I just can't do it. It's triggering my own food addiction issues and upsetting to most of the other friends. Even if money wasn't a concern, I cannot do this.

- 

To be fair, nobody went hungry. I've had bariatric surgery, so I cannot eat a full piece of lasagna. Joan prefers to fill up on lighter food like salad. She and I often share one piece, which Polly knew. I think now that she told Melissa precisely how much she'd be able to load. As I look back, I see more and more how much pre-planning went into this.

- 

I always thought I did provide all-you-can-eat. I want my guests to be stuffed and satisfied. It's part of my cultural background to feed people as a gesture of love. That's why I made two lasagnas when I could have gotten by with one, cutting pieces smaller. But I've never met someone whose food addiction was that extensive. I want to be clear that I see her as sick, not an evil, greedy person.

14-Layer ""I Must Be Crazy"" Lasagna Recipe - as Requested

this is not a once-a-month recipe to add to the rotation. Also to add an ingredient I forgot. This is a special occasion, I want to show off/make someone feel incredibly special sort of recipe. I make it like twice a year for a particular group of people I love very much. I posted it because I mentioned it in another group and a bunch of people were asking.  
  
**14-Layer Lasagna**

This is my “I must be crazy” lasagna recipe that a bunch of people have asked me to post. It’s incredibly decadent but quite delicious. It’s from a mix of other recipes, including some hints from Kenji and from my mum's recipe, and some from my head. You might find yourself adjusting measurements or seasonings to suit your own palate. I tend to cook by feel and instinct, so these measurements are about the closest I can come. But lasagna really is one of those foods that nobody uses exact recipes for, so see this as a guide.

I usually make this over 2 or 3 days because it tastes better to let the sauces sit and then the assembled lasagnas sit to let the flavours mingle, but it’s still good if you have to do it all the same day. Warning… that will be one LONG day. Give yourself 8 hours from start till serving time.

First off, you need a pan at least 6 inches deep, because this thing gets TALL. Mine end up  somewhere between 4-6 inches tall, depending on how thick I make the layers. And this is 4-6 inches on a ruler, not what your last hookup told you was 4-6 inches. This recipe is for two 9X13 pans, because that’s usually how I make it. You have to cut everything in half if you're just doing one, but that's way too much work to just make one lasagna, so make two and put one in the freezer. They'll freeze well (just don't add the top cheese). Let it thaw for 2 days in the fridge before baking. It takes for freaking ever to thaw.

*A note about the meats: Veal and lamb tend to be fattier meats, so you’ll lose more volume to melted fat that you’ll need to drain out. So if you’re using lean ground beef, use more veal and lamb than you do beef if you want the meat amounts to be equal.*

***Component Ingredients:***

**Beef Sauce**:

500-650 grams ground beef (around 1-1.5 lbs)

Salt and pepper to taste

250 grams chopped onion (about a cup)

250 grams finely chopped celery (about a cup)

4 tbsp olive oil

2 cloves minced garlic

A few sprigs basil leaves, chopped finely

A few sprigs oregano leaves, chopped finely

2 bay leaves

2 tbsp fish sauce

250 ml red wine

250 ml milk

750-1000 ml pureed tomatoes (Use the higher amount if the tomatoes are fresh; you can do the lower amount if they’re canned because they’ve already reduced some)

**Lamb Sauce:**

500-650 grams ground lamb (around 1.5 lbs)

Salt and pepper to taste

250 grams chopped onion (about 1 cup)

250 grams chopped carrot (about 1 cup)

4 tbsp olive oil

2 cloves minced garlic

A few sprigs of finely chopped rosemary leaves (at least 3 tbsp)

A few sprigs of finely chopped oregano (a bit less than the rosemary)

1 tbsp cumin

1 tbsp pureed anchovy paste

250 ml dry white wine

250 ml milk

750-1000 ml pureed tomatoes (Use the higher amount if the tomatoes are fresh; you can do the lower amount if they’re canned because they’ve already reduced some)

**Veal Sauce**:

500-650 grams ground veal (around 1.5 lb)

Salt and pepper to taste

250 grams chopped onion (about 1 cup)

250 grams chopped leek (about 1 cup)

4 tbsp olive oil

2 cloves minced garlic

A few sprigs of finely chopped basil leaves

A few sprigs of finely chopped parsley

A few sprigs of finely chopped marjoram

2 tbsp fish sauce

250 ml chicken stock

250 ml milk

750-1000 ml pureed tomatoes (Use the higher amount if the tomatoes are fresh; you can do the lower amount if they’re canned because they’ve already reduced some)

*A note about sauces: If you don’t want to do three separate sauces, you can mix all three meats together. Basically, just throw all the ingredients of all of the sauces in the same pot, following the procedure I outline below. It will be tasty, with very layered, complex flavour.*

**Ricotta Cheese Blend:**

1.5 litres ricotta

750 gm grated parmigiano-reggiano or parmigiano… get the fresh stuff and grate... do not sully this beautiful piece of culinary artwork with powder, please.

500 gm grated old white cheddar

6 eggs

I cup finely chopped parsley

**Pasta:**

If you’re using premade noodles, you’ll need 18-30 *PER LASAGNA*, depending on how many you like to put on each layer. Minimum coverage is 3 noodles per layer, but I often do five to ensure max coverage, and my pans are a little bigger than 9X13. So, altogether you need 36-60. If you’re making your own pasta in sheets, remember each lasagna needs six layers of pasta.

**Top Cheese:**

1000 grams grated mozzarella and 4 large balls of fresh mozzarella. I use the ones that are like the size of a small fist. You might want more or less. Sometimes I add in some old white cheddar here, too.

***Component Instructions:***

**Meat Sauces (the procedure is the same for all three):**

*Note: Have EVERYTHING chopped, measured, and ready to go, at least for the first time you make it. Goes much easier and you won't burn anything. The herbs, I always use fresh, and unless otherwise stated, I tend to use about 2 tbsp of each in each sauce. Some people might find this a bit overpowering, so you might wish to start with less and adjust to taste halfway through the cooking process.*

Brown the meat. Drain the fat if there’s too much.

Add in salt and pepper to taste

Add vegetables, cook till onions soften some. The rest of the veg will soften nicely during the simmering, but onions don’t do that well.

Take meat and veg out of pan and set aside.

Heat olive oil in pan on medium to medium high.

Add garlic, cook for a minute or two until it starts to get a bit brown but don’t burn it

Add half the herbs and anchovy/fish sauce for those sauces, stir for just a minute to activate the flavour oils, but don’t brown or burn them

Add wine/stock immediately. Stir the pan with a wooden spoon to deglace and get the stuck bits off the bottom.

Add milk.

Add meat and veg back in.

Add tomatoes

Cook on low for 1.5-3 hours, stirring every 20 mins. You want a bit of simmering, but not too much because the stuff on the bottom will burn. Add the other half of the herbs halfway through cooking, leaving some out if you think the taste will be too strong. The sauce volume will reduce because there is a lot of water in there, but remember that you’ll need about 1.5 litres of each in the end. You can get by with less, depending on how thick you like your layers. I like mine thick, so 1.5 litres works for me. Taste your sauces at the end. You might want to adjust for flavours, adding salt or something. Depends on how you like things to taste. I’m not a huge fan of a lot of salt. Take the bay leaves out of the beef sauce.

Best to let the sauces sit overnight in the fridge if you have time, but it’s okay if you don’t.

**Ricotta Cheese Blend:**

Make this right before you assemble. Whisk the eggs, then add the ricotta and parsley, then fold in the other cheeses. It will be a bit runny, but the eggs will cook and firm it up in the oven.

**Pasta:**

Cook your noodles to *al dente* unless you’re using the kind that need no cooking. If you use cooked noodles, I advise you rinse them in cold water and throw in a bit of olive oil so they don’t stick together. Then have a huge bowlful of them ready for when it’s time to assemble.

**Top Cheese:** don’t worry about that yet; it doesn’t go on until halfway through the baking.

**Assembly:**

GREASE YOUR PANS. I mean, it’s still gonna be a mess, but this helps a bit.

If you’re not good at eyeballing measurements, divide your components into the right number of layers first. Put each meat sauce into two bowls with a bit more than a third in each, and then two bowls with the remaining sauces mixed together. So all together to make 2 lasagnas, you need 2 bowls of beef sauce, 2 bowls of veal sauce, 2 bowls of lamb sauce, and then 2 bowls of the remnants mixed up. I cannot do the math on how to divide that, so you’ll have to figure it out. All those bowls of sauce should be close to equal in amount. I like at least 500 ml for each meat sauce layer, but you can make do with a less.

For the ricotta cheese mix, you need three bowls of sauce for each lasagna, so 6 altogether. I like at least 500 ml of mix per layer. The amount in the recipe should come close.

**Assemby Order:**

Each lasagna goes in this order:

Beef sauce

Pasta

Ricotta cheese mix

Pasta

Lamb sauce

Pasta

Ricotta cheese mix

Pasta

Veal sauce

Pasta

Ricotta cheese mix

Pasta

Mix of meat sauces

**Stop there.** If you’re baking the next day, wrap them tight in plastic wrap, put them in the fridge overnight (the flavours mix better). But same-day baking is fine, too. If it's same-day baking, go to Baking Time and Temp.

If you’re baking the next day, let the lasagnas sit on the counter a bit before you put them in the oven. This is super important if you’re using a glass dish, because sometimes those crack with sudden temperature changes. I live in a cold climate, so my house is usually cool. I would not advise leaving something with raw eggs on the counter for a long time in Florida summer heat.

**Baking Temp and Time:**

I use a convection over at about 300-325 degrees F. These puppies are THICK, so you don’t want the outside to cook too fast whilst the middle is raw. So don’t go too hot, even with a convection oven. It might take you a few tries to figure out what works best for you.

Cover each lasagne with foil (***SHINY SIDE DOWN***) and bake for about an hour to a hour and a half. I do an hour if I'm making it all the same day and the sauces are warm, an hour and a half if I've chilled them overnight.

Take them out. Leave oven on.

Uncover and add the fresh and the grated mozzarella. I usually lay the fresh down in slices and then sprinkle the grated overtop. How much cheese you want is really up to you. Carefully tent the foil (***SHINY SIDE DOWN***) round the edge of each pan to prevent the edges from burning. Grease the foil if it might touch the cheese so it doesn't stick. Leave the middle open so steam can escape or the lasagna will be way too juicy. Put them back in and bake for another hour or hour and a half.

*Note on Temperature and Baking Time: Oven temperatures are really variable, so you have to pay attention. One to two hours into the baking process, cut into the middle of each lasagna, all the way down, and see if the layers are cooked through. Check again every 30 mins. The ricotta layers will be kind of firm, and of course everything’s piping hot. My oven takes almost 3 hours to bake them through after I've put them in the fridge overnight (I usually do that because I'm way too lazy to make everything the same day),, but others might be different. If you do all cooking and assembly on the same day and the sauces are hot when they go in the pan, that will reduce cooking time.*

I’ve gained the “DOGE 15”. You?,"My fellow Feds and I were taking about the constant stress since Jan20, 2025  - Russell Vought's dream - have caused us to drink more, sleep less, stress eat. One of them said, ""yeah, I'm going to gain the DOGE 15"". Then it hit me that the weight gain I've experienced has a name! No solution yet but I have a name and I will lose my DOGE 15. Am I alone in having gained weight (I'm too scared to check but I bet it's ~15 lbs.)? ",1jynp77,n/a,2025-04-14 01:49:05
I startled myself by thinking I was someone pretty ,"A couple days ago I was shopping for new sunglasses because I work in the woods and am constantly losing or breaking mine. I was having a shitty day. I just completed a pretty difficult course a month or so ago and I had given up the gym for a few weeks, just stress eating and feeling frustrated. I'd put on a couple pounds and while my work keeps me moving, I was angry at myself for ""letting myself go"". I even got off the dating apps for awhile because my self concept had tanked so hard over a short time. So there I was, bitterly looking at sunglasses in a store, when I decided to walk to another section and I passed a woman who was walking near me. I only saw her in my peripheral vision but I kind of straightened up automatically because she was very beautiful, with long dark hair and a cute top, and I felt self conscious being near her. I turned to see if she needed to get by me, and almost shit myself, because it was a fucking MIRROR. I was the woman I had thought was beautiful! I looked at my dumbfounded expression in the big mirror and started laughing. I felt so silly, and yet it was like a load came off my shoulders. I realized I didn't need to worry about a couple stress pounds because if I myself thought I was beautiful, my god, that's all that really mattered. I wanted to share this with other women who maybe haven't felt their best selves lately. I hope you smile lovingly at your reflection today. ",1dz39lx,n/a,2024-07-09 14:05:32
AITA for blowing up at my stepsister at her comments about my lost weight?,"My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.

When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was ""cooler"" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like ""fatass"" and ""chubster"". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).

By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.

Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  
""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  
""But you're way older!"" she whined.

I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.

AITA?

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not ""bordering"" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese.",efz1kb,n/a,2019-12-26 18:35:45
Update: My (25M) girlfriend's (25F) sex drive has completely disappeared,"Warning: long update ahead. Here's the link to the previous post- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iq1ebc/my_25m_girlfriends_25f_sex_drive_has_completely/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb

Thanks to everyone who replied to my previous post. There were some mixed responses, with some people suggesting I insist on addressing it with her because she's hiding something, with others recommending I give her time to open up on her own.

Ultimately I decided to sort of go for a combo of the two. Friday, when we were both done with work, we sat down and had a discussion.

I told her that I could give her the space and time she needed till she was ready to talk to me about it, but I couldn't leave it unaddressed. She needed to acknowledge that there atleast WAS something that she didn't feel ready to tell me, and that was fine, but she atleast needed to acknowledge its existence, if only so I stopped feeling like I was going crazy.

She started sobbing when I was done and then she started explaining everything.

Some background that I didn't mention in my previous post because it didn't really seem relevant is that my girlfriend has PCOD. One of the consequences of this is that she finds it very difficult to lose weight and has been insecure about her body for most of her life. About a year ago (completely of her own choice, I have always told her that she's beautiful to me no matter what her weight), she resolved to start losing weight, both for her health and to feel better about her body. She started going to the gym a couple times a week, and I was supportive and also cut out all my own junk food consumption in solidarity.

Since the lockdown started and gyms shut, apparently she started slowly gaining some weight back due to stress eating and lack of exercise. I am ashamed to say I did not even notice that she was torturing herself over her weight all this while. She admitted that she stopped having sex because she was terrified I would stop finding her attractive after seeing her naked. I reassured her that I think she's gorgeous and attractive no matter what and I tell her this everyday, but she was afraid that would have changed once I saw the weight she had put on.

The rest of the conversation consisted of me reassuring her that she's beautiful and her appreciating but not really believing me. After a bit, she asked me to change the topic, and I reluctantly agreed. We had a fairly quiet dinner, she was a little sad and relieved at the same time at having told me, I think. And I was busy scheming.

The next morning before work I told her she looked lovely again and she gave me a wan smile, like she appreciated it but didn't really believe me. But that was okay. I was gonna convince her. I asked her to pick up the groceries that evening because I was gonna have a meeting run late.

The moment she left home, I got to work. I dug out some fairy lights and a bunch of candles from storage and started setting them up in the living room. Made a couple of playlists and charged the speaker. Snuck down to the florist and bought a giant bouquet.

Some more background, I hate dancing because I suck massively at it, while my girlfriend loves it. She used to go dancing every month or two with her girlfriends before lockdown. I'd join in sometimes because it was worth how happy it made her, but she definitely missed it way more than me.

So when she got back, naturally I greeted her with what were probably the most ridiculous dance moves in the history of mankind.

I'm not gonna lie, folks. She laughed. She laughed a lot. She took a short video, and we both laughed while watching it later. My movement resembled a five year old practicing kung fu more than it resembled dancing, and I had stuck a rose in my ear for maximum ridiculousness. Totally worth it, though. I have no idea how she ever thought she's ugly, her smile is just so fucking radiant.

We danced like idiots for a while before I switched to the slow dance playlist. It was definitely the happiest I'd seen her in a long time. I'd been a bad boyfriend and somehow missed how much she missed everything else. I should have done it months ago.

I told her all this. Told her she's the most beautiful woman in my eyes and always will be. And yeah, we had sex. Last night was all about her. She needed to feel special and I had been missing that for too long.

I offered to make dance nights a weekly thing afterwards. Kind of as a substitute for the workouts she's been missing, if she wants. She tore up a little, she knows how much I hate dancing. She told me that wasn't necessary.

Apparently sex is just as much of a workout as dancing. And we have a lot of missed workouts to catch up on. I'm certainly not complaining.

In all seriousness though, I'm gonna dip into my savings a little and order a home treadmill. She can't afford one right now because of college bills, so I'll surprise her with it :)

Thank you to everyone who helped me out with their advice!

Edit: Oh wow, I am completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support here. Thanks for all the awards! I just logged back into this account but I promise I'm going to read each of the replies. One thing I saw pop up a couple of times that I just wanna reassure you guys about is that she's mentioned wanting a treadmill but not being able to afford one several times in the past, so I know she wants one.

However, I figured that it's dumb to take the chance, and one surprise was good enough, and if there's anything this whole experience has taught me, it's the importance of communication. So I'm going to bring it up at dinner tonight that I comfortably have enough saved up to purchase a home workout machine (since I saw cycles/ellipticals being mentioned, we'll figure out which one we want!), and that I'd love to buy one for our home for both of us to use. Thank you all so much once again for your advice!

Edit 2: RIP me, lol, the comments are coming faster than I can read them now. There's no way for me to reply to every one of them, unfortunately. There are a lot of fantastic suggestions for diets, exercise machines, dance classes and everything in between, so thank you so much for all of them! She has a great endocrinologist, who's advice she will ultimately be following, but there are some great points to bring up with him. It is really touching and overwhelming to see all this support. Thank you all so much!

Final Edit: She loved the idea of getting some equipment to do our workouts at home together, so we're going to sit down and do our research tonight before picking the one we like most. We've gotten some fantastic advice here and we'll be looking at ellipticals, bikes, rowing machines, Just Dance on the Switch and a bunch of other stuff that you guys suggested.

To all the people who commented to insist she's cheating on me because I'm a simp (lmao), thank you for setting the exemplary standard for being macho. Insulting strangers online is so delightfully masculine. The lovely folks who told me to dump her ""because she's fat"" get the ""disappointing but not unexpected shitheads"" shout-out as well.

For the overwhelming majority of people, though, I am just breathtaken by the kind and supportive comments we've gotten. Thank you for the treasure trove of advice and LPTs, and all the love! You folks are amazing!",is8ayb,n/a,2020-09-13 22:31:42

TA as I do not want this story to be associated with my main.

I(28M) have found out that my fiancee(30F) of 2 years cheated on me. We have been together for 6 years and in-love with each other. At least that's how it was for me. She has been acting more distant and became more protective of her phone for the last 2 months. At first, I was not suspicious of anything but the doubt grew more and more inside me as the time passed. Especially after asking her if there was a problem since she felt distant. She said there is no problem and that was it.

I gave in and snooped on her phone to discover she has been sexting a guy for the last 2 months. I was devastated. At the beginning of our relationship I clearly told her lying and cheating in any form are the two unforgivable actions for me. Yet, she decided to cheat on me after 5 years of relationship and we had been planning the wedding for this summer. I am not proud of that but I checked the old messages as well but there was no case of cheating other than this.

I have been thinking about it for the last few days. I tried to rationalize it and told myself I cannot be leaving a 6 years relationship because of a single mistake but after having a long talk with my oldest sister, I realized that I should respect myself and leave. She was the one who betrayed the relationship, not me.

We do not have any shared assets and lease is on my fiancee's name. I have an inherited house but it's in another city. Tomorrow, I am planning to just get important things from the house, block her from everywhere and just leave. I do not want a closure to be honest. I just want to grieve the relationship. I thought maybe I did not love her given that I want to leave her right away but it's not like that. It hurts a lot. I tend to stress eat, masturbate, doom scroll and spiral into depression in these kinds of situations. I have that experience from my early 20s. By going no contact and returning back to the city where my family lives will give me a circle that can support me.

WIBTAH if I straight up left and ghosted her without saying anything?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, based on the comments, OOP was NTA along with a few mixed reactions**

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Wintroza** You should heavily consider to share them with important parties such as your ex's parents. Otherwise they might harass you or spread vile lies that your ex might tell them to save face.

Remember that it's easier to explain your side before people are filled with rage/doubts about your character.

It really sucks to hear what you are going through. I wish you the best of luck navigating it all.

> **OOP:** It might create legal problems though.

**Superb_Trifle513** I second all the comments that call for you to keep screenshots as evidence. If you do go ahead with ghosting, the likelihood is that without explanation from you, she's going to play the poor, abandoned fiancée and claim she has no clue why you've left. This way, if you have proof, she can't play the victim and turn you into some sort of monster.

I wouldn't personally ghost, I would have at least a conversation, even if it was only to very firmly say ""I'm leaving and I want nothing to do with you. Do not contact me or my family"" and then I would make sure they know why, however I can't judge you for just wanting to get out immediately. 

NTA.

> **OOP:** I have the screenshot texts. I do not think she would be able to victimize herself here.

**butterlytea** NTA sure an explanation would be “nice” but who cares about being nice at this point. Also I’m sure you don’t want to hear her excuses/lies. Leaving this way might be for the best if you guys need closure that can be done in the future. You can only go from here! Good luck

> **OOP:** Yes. The main thing is that I do not want to hear lies and excuses. She cheated and that's it for me. It does not matter why after that.

[Update](https://redd.it/1b5lf72) - **March 3, 2024** 

My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1b4juvt/wibtah_for_straight_up_leaving_and_ghosting_my/?sort=new) was deemed as spam for some reason and I cannot post on this subreddit with the other account.

Firstly, I will not spread screenshots on social media or anywhere. That's illegal and a low-blow even if it does not contain sexual parts. It's a private thing and I am not planning to use these unless she plays dirty.

One of my sisters came early in the morning to take me after my fiancee left for the work and we packed some small things. As the lease is on her name, I do not have furnitures and stuff. We packed clothes, accessories and other small and personal things. Her car is an SUV type so we were able to fit most of the required things thankfully. I could not take the ring though.

I left the keys under the flower pot and put a sticky on the refrigerator saying ""I know, bye"". Drive took about 7 hours and we safely arrived to the inherited house. On the ride I received countless messages and calls from unknown numbers but did not answer. Once we arrived at the home, eldest sister called me asking if we arrived. She told me fiancee called her crying around 3pm and my sister told her not to contact me, we know everything and if she tries to paint me bad in anyway we would not use only words but do not back away from showing solid proofs to people. Fiancee requested to know where I am and speak to me. My sister said I am fine and she should not contact me in any form. When fiancee said we at least deserve a closure, my sister replied ""too bad, suck it up""(not exactly that but that's how I would translate that idiom) and ended the call. I still get calls and messages from unknown numbers. In the end her father and mother called me. Surprisingly, my fiancee came clean to them and while they hoped me to give a chance to her, they respected my decision. I thanked them and wished best of luck. Her father told me he will be sending the ring's money and asked me for my bank account. He actually sent it by adjusting to inflation so I got a pretty decent money.

The house is in an almost perfect condition as we renovated it before mom passed away. It's just incredibly dusty and dirty after not being used since then. My 3 sisters will come this weekend and we'll clean it together. Eldest broke up with her girlfriend recently so she plans to live with me after her lease ends in few months. She has been complaining about the rent prices for a while. My sisters are pretty much my only family so I only informed them with some really close friends.

I am planning on going to therapy after settling here. It may sound weird how close I am with my sisters but we grew up like that. We grew up with an abusive father and as I was the only man & youngest one all of the physical and emotional abuse went towards me. We bonded with each other through trauma and they tend to be a bit protective with me. I think that history is one of the reasons I just did not want to face my ex-fiancee. I thought I got over that considering nothing happened since family therapy we took but it seems to be there. I'll get into therapy as soon as possible to understand everything and resolve the problems.

I will post if there are any updates but I just hope there will not be any. I just want to have peace and grieve right now.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Seeker_ofLight:** It sounds as if you are on the right path and have a good support system. Yay sisters for having your back!! Good luck!

>**OOP:** Thank you! I did not know what I would do if my sisters weren't there.

**Inevitable_Bunny109** OP, I am so happy for you and good for you for getting out. I read your original post. Your message to her was perfect: short, sweet, and to the point.

>**OOP:** Thank you! I tried to keep it as short as possible. Many people said it would be weird to disappear without a simple note so that's what I did.

**usurpu** this was not an easy thing to go through, it's great that your family and her parents are supportive and understanding, she made the wrong choice and has to live with the consequences of her actions

>**OOP:** Her parents are incredible people. I am glad they did not push for anything further.

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/coSb5KcPwK): **September 10, 2020**

Pretty much the title. I'm very concerned about her at this point and I have no idea what to do.

Back in April-ish, we were having sex 2-3 times a day. We live in an apartment together, she's been taking online classes for her Master's and I'm working from home since the lockdown started. At some point, she got really busy and tired with a project, so we obviously stopped having sex temporarily.

Since it's gotten over though (which was nearly 4 months ago at this point), she's turned me down every time I've tried to initiate or set the mood for sex. I have NEVER pressured her, I usually wait a couple of nights before asking again when she tells me she's not in the mood, which turned into waiting a week, which turned into waiting two weeks. At this point I'm really concerned, we've never gone anywhere near 4 months without sex before, we've both always had pretty high sex drives.

At this point it's important to note that I do NOT press the matter or pester or pressure her in any way. The moment she says she's not in the mood, I back off immediately. I don't think I've fucked up anywhere because she's always quite apologetic when she turns me down. Our relationship is pretty much perfect in every other way too, we cuddle and hug and have game nights and movie nights, it's never felt like we're drifting apart at any point. She hasn't been behaving differently, like she's upset or depressed. We give each other plenty of space too, it's not like we're constantly together, we have our own friend circles and we curl up on our own devices from time to time.

I've tried talking to her about it, but she gets really upset and keeps insisting that nothing is wrong. I drop the matter pretty quickly too because I don't want her to feel like I'm pressuring her to have sex. I just want her to let me in and tell me what's wrong.

I honestly don't care about the sex, but I know there's something she's not telling me and it's gone on long enough that I'm getting extremely worried about her.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** If I was in your place, I too wouldn't pressure her for sex, but I damn well would pressure her for an explanation. From 2 to 3 times A DAY to not at all for 4 months? I would need answers, even if she was upset at having the conversation. It's OK to want (or not want) things in a relationship, but not communicating is not ok.

> **OOP:** Thanks for the response. I don't want her to feel pressured or accused of anything but I do want an explanation. Do you have any advice on how I can be sort of firm but also make her feel comfortable at the same time?

**Commenter 2:** It’s been a very stressful year for everyone, she’s probably just feeling the pressure. I wouldn’t worry that much, if it really bothers you try doing small intimate things: head massage, cuddle etc.

> **OOP:** We've been cuddling and I've been giving her shoulder massages on a fairly regular basis, and she seems very content and happy. Everything seems completely normal except this. I want her to atleast talk about this.

**Could the girlfriend being dealing with a prior traumatic experience?**

> **OOP:** I keep worrying about a traumatic experience too, but what? We almost never leave home because of the pandemic. One of us goes occasionally to get groceries but that's about it. I'm honestly at a loss and she's not talking to me about it.

**Is the girlfriend taking any medication that might be affecting her moods?**

> **OOP:**No, she isn't taking any medication

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/8rTv6B774b): **September 13, 2020 (three days later)**

The rest of the conversation consisted of me reassuring her that she's beautiful and her appreciating but not really believing me. After a bit, she asked me to change the topic, and I reluctantly agreed. We had a fairly quiet dinner, she was a little sad and relieved at the same time at having told me, I think. And I was busy scheming.

The next morning before work I told her she looked lovely again and she gave me a wan smile, like she appreciated it but didn't really believe me. But that was okay. I was gonna convince her. I asked her to pick up the groceries that evening because I was gonna have a meeting run late.

The moment she left home, I got to work. I dug out some fairy lights and a bunch of candles from storage and started setting them up in the living room. Made a couple of playlists and charged the speaker. Snuck down to the florist and bought a giant bouquet.

Some more background, I hate dancing because I suck massively at it, while my girlfriend loves it. She used to go dancing every month or two with her girlfriends before lockdown. I'd join in sometimes because it was worth how happy it made her, but she definitely missed it way more than me.

So when she got back, naturally I greeted her with what were probably the most ridiculous dance moves in the history of mankind.

I'm not gonna lie, folks. She laughed. She laughed a lot. She took a short video, and we both laughed while watching it later. My movement resembled a five year old practicing kung fu more than it resembled dancing, and I had stuck a rose in my ear for maximum ridiculousness. Totally worth it, though. I have no idea how she ever thought she's ugly, her smile is just so fucking radiant.

We danced like idiots for a while before I switched to the slow dance playlist. It was definitely the happiest I'd seen her in a long time. I'd been a bad boyfriend and somehow missed how much she missed everything else. I should have done it months ago.

I told her all this. Told her she's the most beautiful woman in my eyes and always will be. And yeah, we had sex. Last night was all about her. She needed to feel special and I had been missing that for too long.

I offered to make dance nights a weekly thing afterwards. Kind of as a substitute for the workouts she's been missing, if she wants. She tore up a little, she knows how much I hate dancing. She told me that wasn't necessary.

Apparently sex is just as much of a workout as dancing. And we have a lot of missed workouts to catch up on. I'm certainly not complaining.

In all seriousness though, I'm gonna dip into my savings a little and order a home treadmill. She can't afford one right now because of college bills, so I'll surprise her with it :)

Thank you to everyone who helped me out with their advice!

**Edit:** Oh wow, I am completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support here. Thanks for all the awards! I just logged back into this account but I promise I'm going to read each of the replies. One thing I saw pop up a couple of times that I just wanna reassure you guys about is that she's mentioned wanting a treadmill but not being able to afford one several times in the past, so I know she wants one.

However, I figured that it's dumb to take the chance, and one surprise was good enough, and if there's anything this whole experience has taught me, it's the importance of communication. So I'm going to bring it up at dinner tonight that I comfortably have enough saved up to purchase a home workout machine (since I saw cycles/ellipticals being mentioned, we'll figure out which one we want!), and that I'd love to buy one for our home for both of us to use. Thank you all so much once again for your advice!

**Edit 2:** RIP me, lol, the comments are coming faster than I can read them now. There's no way for me to reply to every one of them, unfortunately. There are a lot of fantastic suggestions for diets, exercise machines, dance classes and everything in between, so thank you so much for all of them! She has a great endocrinologist, who's advice she will ultimately be following, but there are some great points to bring up with him. It is really touching and overwhelming to see all this support. Thank you all so much!

**Final Edit:** She loved the idea of getting some equipment to do our workouts at home together, so we're going to sit down and do our research tonight before picking the one we like most. We've gotten some fantastic advice here and we'll be looking at ellipticals, bikes, rowing machines, Just Dance on the Switch and a bunch of other stuff that you guys suggested.

To all the people who commented to insist she's cheating on me because I'm a simp (lmao), thank you for setting the exemplary standard for being macho. Insulting strangers online is so delightfully masculine. The lovely folks who told me to dump her ""because she's fat"" get the ""disappointing but not unexpected shitheads"" shout-out as well.

For the overwhelming majority of people, though, I am just breathtaken by the kind and supportive comments we've gotten. Thank you for the treasure trove of advice and LPTs, and all the love! You folks are amazing!

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** Dance lessons, a great thing Todo as a couple.

> **OOP:** Shhh, don't give her ideas!
> 
> But in all seriousness, probably after the pandemic. It is long overdue for me to fix my woeful dance abilities haha

**OOP clarifies the differences between PCOS and PCOD**

> **OOP:** Hey! PCOS and PCOD differ just slightly and can often be mistaken for each other since they have very similar symptoms. PCOS is caused by a disorder in the endocrine system, which controls the hormonal balance of the body, whereas PCOD is due to a hormonal imbalance rather than a system issue.
I'm very sorry to hear you have it. I wish you the best of luck dealing with it.

**OOP should make sure his girlfriend is okay with getting a treadmill or it could be a major setback for her. Because she hasn’t asked for anything yet to help with her weight**

> **OOP:** You make a great point, and even though she's explicitly mentioned wanting one before, this was the comment that convinced me to bring it up with her rather than try to surprise her again. I'm going to frame it as buying one for our home for the both of us to use, so she doesn't feel targeted or guilty about me spending money. Thank you so much for the advice!

**OOP was advised to bring up a possible PCOS/PCOD related issue to his girlfriend’s doctor. She might have issues with low progesterone levels which could be the root cause**

> **OOP:** Oh wow, thanks for the heads up! I will definitely bring this up with her and we'll book a consultation ASAP. She has a regular endocrinologist already who's been very good up to this point.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update: We got married!](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThrowRA-Girlfriend/s/AakXHNexEE): **December 24, 2024 (four years later)**

Hi everyone! I spotted an end-of-year email from Reddit for this account, which reminded me of the existence of this throwaway, and I decided to do a quick Christmas Eve update on my profile page in case anyone was still interested, because a lot has happened in 4 years.

We're both doing well! We got engaged about three years ago and adopted a cat, but it went a bit downhill from there because of a bunch of different health issues that hit her consecutively. She's largely recovered from the temporary ones, and the permanent ones are a lot more under control now thanks to regular health checkups and medication, but it was a rocky couple of years (not for our relationship, just for us in general). All the medical issues also meant she hasn't worked since, which isn't an issue financially but for other reasons which I'll come to in a moment.

She's doing a lot better mentally now as well, atleast relative to last year. She still struggles with self-esteem and feeling like a burden to her loved ones, especially me, especially because of the aforementioned lack of work over the last few years. She's a lot more communicative about these things now though instead of bottling them up, so she's not let our relationship suffer for this. And I like to think that even if her self-esteem hasn't gone up, her way of coping with it is a lot healthier now, and that's an important step in the right direction. She's even been looking to get back to work over the last month or so, despite the challenges of low self-esteem, severe imposter syndrome, and having to explain a years-long absence, and I'm really proud of her for not just giving up after the hand she's been dealt health-wise.

I'm doing really well! I switched jobs and fields about a year back and I'm making a lot more money now, and I'm enjoying my work a lot more too. I actually started therapy recently as well, because there were some personal discipline issues I wanted to fix, and I ended up discovering a whole host of other issues I had repressed, and bringing them back out into the open and dealing with them has been simultaneously terrifying and liberating. But it's also made me a much better friend and partner, so looks like I'm gonna have to keep braving them for as long as it takes!

As for the biggest one (as is probably obvious from the title), we got married two months ago! We would have done it a lot earlier if she hadn't had a bunch of health issues pop up unexpectedly, but with her on the mend, we were finally able to plan and organize the thing so everyone we wanted to be there could be there. I honestly sometimes still find it surreal, like wtf I'm a husband?! It still feels like I'm dreaming sometimes and I'm still that clueless wide-eyed college kid, but I look at the woman sleeping next to me and I remember all the ways I've changed for the better, all the ways I've grown up because of her influence, and I feel really lucky to have her. And I know that I (and she) still have a lot more growing up to do, but I'm feeling this overwhelming contentedness within because we get to do all that growing up together.

I don't know if I'll update this again, maybe if I get reminded of this account sometime in the future, and something major has happened since. Until then, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone, and I hope the New Year is your best year yet!

AITA for eating all four pints of Ben and Jerry's ice cream?,"I (26f) live with a roommate (26f). We don't grocery shop together, but I have no problem with it if she ever wants any of my food. In fact, sometimes I'll tell her ""Hey, I got milk/ice cream/cookies/whatever - feel free to help yourself."" She occasionally takes me up on this. I don't ever eat her food, aside from if we're cooking together or if she made something and directly offered it to me. 

Yesterday, I went to the grocery store, and Ben and Jerry's was on sale (2 pints for $4). So I bought 4 pints of some of my favorite flavors, but also one that I knew was my roommate's favorite. When I got home, I let her know there was ice cream in the freezer and that she was welcome to help herself if she wanted any. I ate half a pint yesterday, and roommate didn't eat any.

Today, I was stressed while working (wfh), and I ended up stress eating all the remaining 3.5 pints of ice cream while my roommate was out. When she got home, she saw there was no ice cream left and completely flipped out when I told her I finished it all. She called me a glutton with no self control, and that my offer to share ice cream was really disingenuous if I was just going to pig out on it before anyone else could get to it. And she had been looking forward to a treat after work, and that I had raised her hopes up for nothing. 

I apologized, but pointed out that she could've told me she wanted some and that I should save some. Or that she could've had some last night when I first brought it home. She just lashed out at me, saying this happens way too much. That I'll pretend to be generous with food, but then gorge myself  before anyone else could get any. She then ordered doordash and shut herself in her room.

I get that she was disappointed when she got home, but I feel like it was my ice cream and I was being nice enough to even offer any at all and that she could've let me know if she wanted me to save any. AITA?",10hfyww,n/a,2023-01-21 02:07:22
AITAH for wanting to leave my boyfriend for getting fired twice in the span of 6 months?,"My boyfriend (male, 22) was fired about 6 months ago from his factory job. He and I (female, 24) have lived together for a little over a year. He worked there for over a year and was fired because of his attendance. I got my first real ""big girl job"" this time last year and have been working part-time. I can handle my side of the bills, but he cannot. I had to force him to file for unemployment and make sure he kept up with it. My mom had been helping us financially because of the loss of his job. He gets so angry anytime I tell him that he needs to buckle down and find a job because unemployment was going to end soon, and my mom could no longer help us. During this time, I went into a deep depressive episode and gained a lot of weight from stress eating. Well, just at the right time, he was hired 1 month ago. While at this new job, he was not getting along with a trainer. He was getting in trouble, being asked why he is not committed to this, what's going on, etc. Just last week, he was apparently ignoring his trainer, and she told their manager and left. My boyfriend was sent home and was told they would talk on Monday (today). I dropped him off at work today (yeah, he doesn't have a license, that's a whole other issue) and went home. He soon called me, saying they fired him. 

I picked him up from work, and he told me that they didn't want his side of the story and just fired him. First of all, would they just fire someone for 1 issue? Is he not telling me the whole truth? Over the many months of being unemployed, he would not help with house duties (I am chronically ill and disabled), he foolishly spent money on collectibles even though we had rent and bills to pay, he made zero effort into looking for a new job after I told him many times that I was in the depressive episode because of all the stress, he kept getting mad at me when I told him I didn't want sex, and just treated me bad. 

Our whole relationship has honestly been such a rollercoaster, we have broken up and gotten back together multiple times, he has ghosted me for weeks or a month... 

With all this being said, AITAH for wanting to find someone who is committed to creating a future with me, someone who can handle himself and take care of himself? I just want to feel secure and safe, and I no longer do. 

UPDATE: today I went and viewed an apartment! It was beautiful & I am first on the list. It’s veryyyyy promising. I will be out of this soon 💞",1k4viug,n/a,2025-04-22 02:26:18
How to stop stress eating processed food?,"I have no idea where to ask for advice, but i feel stuck. I'd like to lose weight for my health, but i don't feel like i have the energy to cook and i over eat. I would say stress is the issue causing the imbalance, but unfortunately i cannot control the stress (EVERYTHING is stressfull, job, trying to keep up with rent,having family living at the border with Ukraine, that kind of stress).

So what recipes do you know that are filling, healthy and i feel like i'm eating trash food while eating healthy?


Edit: Thank you all for the support and yummy recipes!!",t3o1fo,n/a,2022-02-28 19:45:06
AITA for incorporating healthy swaps in cooking meals after my husband specifically told me I should lose weight?,"I'm so frustrated by this! I've gained a little weight through the pandemic. Stress eating, less active, etc. I'm 5'1 and 145, so I have a good 40lbs I could lose (I was roughly 125-130 before this all happened) without issue. My husband made a point to say we'd both put on some weight and could do with a change.

Since I'm the one who does most of the cooking and grocery shopping, I started making some healthy swaps in our meals. It's the stuff you'd expect -- instead of just rice to go with a stir fry, I'd do half rice/half cauliflower rice. Instead of just potatoes for mashed potatoes, I'd swap half for caulfilower, and then tinker with the dairy involved as well. Greek yogurt for anything it can be swapped for, etc etc. 

I figured this was perfectly acceptable, because I hadn't heard a complaint. In fact, he enjoyed all of it. I've started seeing the scale go down. 

The other day, he came in while I was making fried rice to go with a stir fry, and he saw me grating the cauliflower. He asked what it was for, and I told him I used it to swap out some of the rice. HE ACTED LIKE I WAS POISONING HIM! He got SO UPSET when I talked more about the things I swap out. He acted like it was this epic betrayal of unparalleled proportions.

I told him that if it bothers him that much, I'll set aside a portion for him before I make any swaps. This wasn't enough for him, because ""What if there's leftovers?"" and ""You shouldn't be doing this to begin with!""

In the end, I told him that I'm going to just continue doing what I'm doing, and if he has such a problem with it, he can start making his own meals, and said, bluntly ""You're acting like a fucking child.""

He's been pouting like a little bitch and making passive aggressive comments about being ""soooo hungry"" and all that.

"Finally got a breast reduction I’ve been waiting for, and here’s my experience","I’m 18 years old and have a severe chronic pain condition caused by my shitty back. So for almost a year now I’ve been in the process of trying to get a breast reduction surgery to try and lighten the load on my spine. (I was a 36HH before surgery)

Because I’m in university (doing a pretty intense engineering degree) I really didn’t want to have to take time off school for the recovery, so scheduling delays were mostly on me. First time around it was scheduled for the middle of December, right after my winter exams. Got cancelled because my surgeon had an emergency cancer case come up (obviously that comes first, no biggie)

Then I scheduled it for the Friday before my February reading week (a little tight for recovery time but I was hoping). Got cancelled because the receptionists messed up the bookings. That was more frustrating, but this surgeon was really good so I knew it was best to just stay the course. 

Third time around: scheduled for May. Was told there’s no way they’d move me because I’ve been pushed back for so long. I would be home for the summer at this point, lots of time to heal, all good right? Then COVID happened. And I mean obviously everything shut down and it’s not about me. But I panicked. All elective surgeries were put on hold, many more important than a breast reduction. How long would it take to start this up again? Where would I be on the list when it did? So many unknowns. 

I spiralled pretty hard. I gained some weight from stress eating, I wasn’t exercising enough, I got out of bed only to do my job (remotely). I felt so lost and hopeless. 

But I got SO lucky. I got a call this past Friday from the surgeon that they had OR time for Tuesday. She fit me in as her very first patient. I literally didn’t even have time to stress about it before. I’m now three days post op. I’m so thankful. I’m in pain still now, but I already feel the weight off my chest (literally). 

She was able to take over 800g out of each side. The swelling will still be coming down for a month or so but I can’t wait to be a normal size. To shop at a regular bra store. To wear shirts that I like instead of just styles that fit me. This is going to make a world of difference for my life, and I can’t wait. 

Sorry this is such a long post.  

TL;DR: after three cancellations I got my reduction surgery very suddenly, and I’m so grateful.

I've gained a lot of weight and my husband finally commented on it.,"Due to a lot of personal issues (stress eating/drinking) and working 70 hour weeks over the last year I've put on about 40 pounds. I've been hating myself for a long time, feeling unattractive, and intimacy between my husband and myself has been non-existant for several months. He has been frustrated recently, and has made comments about our lack of a sex life.

From my perspective he hasn't been interested, and I attributed that to my weight gain and I told him so. He then brought up several occasions where he tried to ""come on to me"" and I shoved him away. Examples include trying to take my towel off after I came out of the shower, trying to snuggle up to me in bed and I refused to allow him to touch me under the blankets, etc.

I had truly been thinking that he found me repulsive and I was actually considering telling him to sleep with other women (he takes care of himself... still in great shape after 20 years of marriage) but when I said to him ""you have a problem with me being fat"" he looked me dead in the eye and said ""I don't have a problem with you being fat. YOU have a problem with you being fat.""

And he's right. He has never made me feel unattractive or unworthy... He is still very much attracted to me and it's my own self conscious that has prevented me from being intimate with him because I feel like I'm less than he deserves. In reality he's the same great guy he ever was and he loves me just the same.

Best friend is angry with me for losing weight.,"So I've done keto on and off since 2017. From 2017-2021 I was strict keto, went from 240lbs (estimate. I don't know my highest weight because I was terrified of a scale) to 147lbs and stayed between 147-153lbs for most of that. 5'7"" for reference.

And I was *healthy.* My blood sugar was fantastic, my previously 11.7 A1C dropped to 5.1 and stayed there. I had energy. I was happy. I didn't think about food constantly. 

And then covid happened, living situation went to shit, moved 2x, bought a house, my mom died, it was stressy. I stress eat. I had also started dating a new guy and while he never pressured me, I eased up on keto until it went away almost completely. Fast food, break room food, potatoes, whatever. I ate it.

So big surprise, I gained back to 229lbs. I felt awful. Blood sugar doing the diabetic dance. Depression at an all time high. Everything I worked so hard for was just gone and I knew why. My eating was out of control.

So back in June I decided to stop fucking around and get back to it. And I'm fine! After the first week, everything fell into places, food cravings went away, no more food noise. I hit 198lbs this week and was so happy for myself. It also started coming off a lot faster this time for me, I think in part because I have a different job position that I end up clocking about 20mi of walking every night and I have a dog now who requires constant activity lol.

But anyway, point of the post. My best friend asked if I would go to a sushi restaurant with her this weekend. I told her I couldn't, but suggested a different place that had sushi but also had other items I could eat. We've been to both places, they're solid. She asks why, I tell her I'm cutting back on carbs for my blood sugar and trying to get back to the weight I was when she met me.

Response? ""Okay but you should know, you looked unhealthy. You were too thin and did not look good. Women under 200lbs just look gaunt to me. You should try to find a way to take care of yourself that doesn't include restricting things you love.""

I initially let it go, and just said it was less about my looks and more about not wanting to start having heart attacks at 35 like my mother did and that I felt amazing with stable blood sugars.

""OK well it might be better for your blood sugar but it's not for your whole body."" Like ma'am. My blood sugar directly impacts every part of my body. I promise it'll all go to shit if that one thing is out of whack. 

I fell asleep and didn't respond to her after that, but woke up to a ton of messages about how she didn't know if she could continue being friends with someone on a diet, that I was killing myself and developing an ED, that I had tied my worth to my weight, and she hoped one day I could be comfortable in my body.

Like YES? That's the point! I am NOT comfortable anymore. I am tired. Things hurt. Like do I want to look good in clothes? Duh, but I also want to *feel* good. I don't want to spend the rest of my life battling highs and lows with blood sugar and crashing out after every meal. I'm not satan for also wanting to fit back into my cute clothes that I spent quite a bit of money on. 🙄",1m9264b,n/a,2025-07-25 15:26:54
AITA for telling my husband that he needs to get himself under control?,"My husband's mom died 5-6 months ago. He was very close to her. Since then, he's started stress eating and has been depressed. He seems like he's been having a existential crisis since she died. His eating is very out of control. He looks like he's gained alot of weight.

I came home from work the other day and he was eating a large bag of taco bell food. I finally told him that he needed to get a hold of himself and stop doing this shit. Then I asked him how long he planned to live like this. He just got upset and just told me to leave him alone. Then went to the guest room and didn't come out till the next day.

We haven't really sat down and talked since then. AITA? I know i was harsh but I am legitimately worried about how he's been spiraling for 6 months.",15n2h3a,n/a,2023-08-10 04:53:16

Step 2) Play more than 86 matches or less than 86 matches.

Step 3) Around match 50, leave your PS4 and stress-eat a yogurt in the kitchen while you're AFK 1v4 against a clan wondering why matchmaking didn't bother putting 3 other guys on your team for, like, the 20th time. Explain the Gambit mechanics to your cat while she freaks out because she can't tell the difference between a yogurt cup and a can of cat food.

Step 4) Lose count of how many matches you've played, and notice you somehow have a level 34 guy on your team versus a clanned 4-stack. Notice another guy on your team is seemingly jumping into the lava on purpose each time he gets 10-15 motes. Know that this will be the Malfeasance spawn, so sit up straight and frantically search for special and heavy ammo that you can't find anywhere.

Step 5) When the Malfeasance spawns for the first time like you knew it would, don't even try because it's essentially 2v4 and you only have primary ammo. Invade over and over out of spite and somehow constantly get team-wipes with your Go Figure, even though you never got them once before. Shoot primary ammo at the Malfeasance boss because you have to pass the time while the other team gets their Exotic quest because they have 4 players and you have a level 34 guy and can't even see the lava-jumper on the map when you look for him. Keep shooting primary ammo at the boss with just one other guy.

Step 6) Hear the re-skinned Servitor's shriek/explosion noises and see that, somehow, you got the Malfeasance quest.

Step 7) Be the best player in all of Destiny because your dedication and skill spawned the boss through challenging-but-rewarding mechanics on which you were able to make direct, tangible progress.

Other things I've skilled my way into in Destiny and Destiny 2:

* Dropping my first Black Hammer after 68 Crota kills
* Getting the Ghost Ghost from Eververse loot boxes after paying $25
* Getting the last piece of gear I needed to hit level 30 from Vault of Glass, long after the Dark Below released and level 30 wasn't the cap anymore
* Never even getting close to the Imago Loop Fatebringer roll after running the strike literally over 100 times
* Not getting my first Exotic this expansion until I was 575, and it was an Armamentarium that was somehow lower light than my current chest piece
* Dropping more snipers with Hip Fire Grip than Edge Transits (I kept track of it)
* Waiting 5-6 hours (actually) for the Taken Blight to spawn for the first time on Io so I could do the Whisper quest that I skipped when I was burnt out during Warmind

Follow this guide, and you too can get the Malfeasance boss to spawn through practice, skill, and having your time respected.",9krhhi,n/a,2018-10-02 15:15:26
