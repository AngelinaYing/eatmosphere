How did you improve your relationship with food?,"Former Emotional Eater Extraordinaire here,

I don't consider anything a ""cheat meal"" anymore. It's just food. I've had almost entire weeks of pizza and pasta before (intentionally) and it's been totally fine because *it's just food*. I can have whatever I want and as much as I want with just a few guidelines. 

1: I can only have an actual single portion size of anything *at a time*. 

2: I have to start my day with 2 cups/glasses of water and then have 2 more between every single meal/snack/non-water beverage I have the rest of the day. Had a brownie and want more? That's fine - I just have to drink 2 cups/glasses of water first. Do I still want more? No problem, but 2 more cups/glasses of water. This has completely nullified me eating my feelings. It keeps me hydrated so I'm not mistaking thirst for hunger and it slows me down so I can't *mindlessly* chow through all the sweets. 

3: I try to make sure I'm getting enough protein, fiber, and vitamins and obviously I try to stick to my calorie goal but here's the thing - As long as I'm following the 2 guidelines above, it's rare for me to go over the calorie goal. 

My go-to ""unplanned"" (I'm peckish and want something sweet/salty/warm/specific-in-some-way) snacks currently:

Mug of Chicken Broth (I like what I like)
Popcorn
Outshine Frozen Fruit Bar
Frozen Yogurt & Fruit Cup
Piece of Fruit
Cup of Tea w/ a little Milk and Sugar

I keep all of these easily accessible and as visible as possible so they're what I naturally reach for. We have heaftier snacks in the the house (chips, baked goods, etc.) as well usually but they get put in less visible/easily reached places.  No issues with me having them but I have to *actually* want one, not just be grabbing it because it's the most convenient. 

For reference: I've been trying this out since January 3rd of this year and it's been a total success. I wouldn't even call myself an emotional snacker/eater anymore. 

Hope this helps and wishing you lots of luck!",12eh9s6,jfbcel5,2023-04-07 13:26:00
How did you improve your relationship with food?,">  ok now I lost weight I don't need to diet anymore, let's have everything I have been avoiding. 

Yo-yo dieting in one sentence.  :-)    We've all done it; at least most of us have.  Me too.

> How did you guys improve your relationship with food?.

Stop calling anything a cheat meal.   Stop thinking of food you enjoy as food you can't have.   Instead:  All food can fit.  It's just a matter of fitting it in.   Sometimes, we have to make it differently.   Sometimes we have to accept smaller portions.   Sometimes, we have to eat a little lighter during the week because we have a lifestyle that eats heavier on Sunday.    Sometimes we have to follow the serving-size on the package even though it's hard to believe that such a small amount is a serving.  

Any diet you have to cheat on is not going to make it long-term.  We not only want to lose the weight, we need to keep it off.  This means including all of our life's food and making it work.   We don't want to give up the foods that we enjoy.   So, it's not a cheat, it's a puzzle we can solve with wisdom and flexibility.",12eh9s6,jfaxk58,2023-04-07 11:03:39
what was the best thing you ever did for your relationship with food?,"Honestly, eating together with others. When I'm deep in the ED it's my worst nightmare because I compare myself all the time. However, looking back now, my most solid periods of recovery were times when I had regular meals with (non-disordered) friends/roommates/classmates. 

It takes the focus away from numbers and macros during the meal and you remember the conversations and jokes instead. Also, IF the others are supportive and have a healthy relationship with food, you can learn what is ""normal"" from them again.",14ed373,joua6or,2023-06-20 15:24:49

I can eat that cookie because I'm not gonna gain weight from eating one cookie. I'll eat other things throughout the day anyway. Life will still roll on.",14ed373,joul4vc,2023-06-20 16:37:29

what was the best thing you ever did for your relationship with food?,"Seconding this.

Meal prepping for the work week with my partner has been so healing. Just making big batches of food together, tasting as we cook, changing the flavor profile until it’s perfect, and then eating together after work when we’re both sleepy and just want to relax. It’s also a big middle finger to my ED, since there’s no way to truly count the calories in a big pot of stew or mass of BBQ.

And it’s just nice to eat with someone you love. If they’re putting the same food in their body, and I love them, what on earth makes me think it’d be any different if I do?",14ed373,joues19,2023-06-20 15:55:22

I'd always feel full enough after the first where I couldnt justify prepping another one.

I didn't always have enough to eat as a kid and even struggled at times in adulthood. Second I remember very clearly my mother talking about how she was the fattest girl in her grade. She was so large, she was disgusting. We found a dress she wore for her confirmation and I tried it on...I couldn't zip it. I was younger than she had been.  I remember looking at the pictures of her in it while she stressed how horribly fat she was and trying to pull the zipper. Until that moment I thought of myself as a normal kid. Thinking you are grossly fat and at the same time being truly hungry is weird. I definitely stress eat almost out of panic like my brain is afraid the food will be taken from me as punishment or because it's just gone.

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing. I’ve never met a woman who doesn’t have a complicated relationship with food.”,"I have a very complicated relationship with food and my body. On one hand, I’m an athlete in an image based sport - my body is constantly evaluated by others and my income depends on those evaluations being positive, which in my world means lean, flexible, strong, graceful. I am accustomed to my body being talked about like I am not there inhabiting it, to having people tell me I need to lose weight/maintain a weight, that I look best a certain way, that I’m too short or not the right “look” for a certain thing, that I need to tone up more but make sure my muscles don’t make me look bulky, stuff like that. It’s part of my life. I also love to cook and bake, I enjoy trying new things and experimenting with how to make them, and I love a food adventure when I can find one. I often have guilt or rationalizing attached to this, and I enjoy the things I want, but on specific schedules and around things where I have to be wary of how I look and feel in my body. I’m currently dealing with knowing that the holidays are here but I have an event on Sunday so I cannot actually indulge until Monday, and then I will have to be ready for another event that’s even higher pressure 2 weeks later. 

So, thus I have had a chronic eating disorder for over 20 years that did not develop from what I do (it started before), but is fed by it. It sits there, under the surface, ever present and I do make those choices to have the salad or steamed vegetables because first off, my income depends on my body looking a certain way, and secondly, I have attached some seriously negative thoughts and patterns to food.

That was six years ago. I have yet to find my way back to a healthy relationship with food. It makes me angry, quite honestly.

You see, I had just started a new job and the schedule didn’t let me work out and it was super high stress and I had put on about 5 pounds. The argument wasn’t even about weight or anything related...it was about taxes! I disagreed with something he said and he just went off on a tirade that ended with that gem of a sentence. 

The relationship is long gone and I am since happily married. However between being middle aged and COVID shutdowns I have gained some weight again, and I swear I keep on hearing his goddamn voice in the back of my head. I hate it!",kjqocu,ggyx9oa,2020-12-25 06:31:35

She would rail on and on about GMOs being evil and how everything was going to give me cancer. So she would spend most of our food budget on expensive organic produce that she wouldn't ever cook and would then go bad, and my dad would spend the rest on junk food. 

My siblings and I all grew up obese. In high-school I started to fast all the time because I was so disgusted with my body and ""I cant lose weight if I eat"" was so ingrained in my brain. I started taking caffeine pills all the time to keep my energy up and curb my hunger. And then i would break and binge like crazy.. I dropped like 40-50lbs in a few months, then gained it back plus more,, and started the cycle over. Ive gotten better and worse a few times over the years. Theres not really a happy ending here. My image of myself is so distorted that I dont think I really know what I look like. Sometimes it feels like my body is just rapidly changing shape and size, even though I know its not.

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing.

But what fucked me up was that my dad would still always tell me that, ""there are poor, hungry kids in Africa, so you need to clean your plate."" So I always cleaned my plate with often adult sized portions. 

Then when my parents got divorced and I lived with my mom who was almost financially ruined, I ate basically only top ramen during one summer while doing my team sport a ton. I remember one parent commenting on my weight loss saying I looked so much more healthy and fit. I was more fit, but definitely not eating healthier because my mom's budget was severely restricted. It really embarrassed me to think that people didn't think I looked healthy before and I started comparing myself to my peers so much more. My inadequacy in sports and poor body image really deteriorated my self worth. 

It got worse in college when I did ROTC. The physical fitness exams test endurance and body composition and you can't pass one part and fail the other. I was scoring 90s on the fitness part, but not meeting weigh ins and fat percentage checks. I was so desperate to stay in and serve my country, I resorted to laxatives and starving starving myself in the weeks leading up to weigh ins and then I would binge in the months after. I eventually was kicked out of ROTC 6 months ahead or graduation and commission for being too fat, while still being fit enough to pass the physical exam.",kjqocu,ggyxdch,2020-12-25 06:33:05

My sister just said in conversation: “It’s disturbing.

It’s uncomfortable at times, I’ve been to group functions where the speaker will make some joke about how all of us women hate our thighs, for example, and everyone laughs while I’m sitting there like... I don’t though? I don’t calorie count, I don’t restrict myself, I’m active and I cook my own food, I eat sweets daily but perhaps my own frugality makes me budget out my treats because I don’t wanna have to go to the store to buy more constantly. 

The constant narrative that if you’re a woman you have to hate your body, or if you’re a thin woman you must hate your body and also starve yourself... I feel like in some cases it silences the voices of those who don’t fit that narrative. Which in turn makes that narrative louder. I’ll admit I would rarely feel comfortable saying “I like my body” to people I don’t know really well, because it would immediately be taken as a negative (bragging, self centred) instead of a positive (uh.. not hating myself.) It tends to drown out the opportunities for us to be proud of self acceptance, and instead echo the idea that self degradation is a trait of a *proper young lady.*",kjqocu,ggywimk,2020-12-25 06:20:37

Since I saw them every day we bonded and sometimes they would bring me snacks.

One day dad brings hotdogs. Cooks them on one of the bbq's and even made on for me. So the 12 year old runs over, with mine in one hand and hers in the other and this sack of garbage masquerading as a middle aged woman turns to this child she does not know and goes ""Oh. 2 hot dogs. Aren't we the little piggy""

And I turned to her and said, ""Excuse me bitch, they're both for me. You gonna call me a piggy too or do you just enjoy shitting on little girls self esteem specifically?"" 

And when she turned with her ""get me your manager"" bs I said ""We have a zero tolerance policy for bullying, you can either leave or be escorted. And escort will also incur a permanent ban"" She of course needed an escort, which was on it's way the second the other lifeguard saw my face. And then I'm like giving this whole spiel to his fucking 12 year old on how she's growing and no one should ever shame her for eating to keep herself healthy and strong, and that if she wants 2 hotdogs she can have 2 hot dogs and it's no ones business but hers. And her dad shows up wondering whats taking her so long and I'm mid rant and he is just like wtf did I miss? (he was very very cool with it when she explained) God I was so mad.

The women in my family pressured me to go for the traditional wedding dress, that's very expensive and you're tempted to buy at an ""aspirational"" size. Even the saleswoman remarked that almost everyone buys the dresses smaller than usual because they intend to lose weight. I found a dress that I didn't care much for but the people with me said I looked great, so I got it - in that aspirational size.

However I didn't lose weight because I like my body how it is. I then went through a whole process of getting the dress let out a size, and finally realized I actually hated the dress and was letting others' opinions get the best of me.

A couple months before my wedding I realized the kind of dress I wanted to get married in - dusty blue, no frills, and some sparkle because I've always loved silly sparkles. Found one that matched that description in the Nordstrom evening wear line, and wore it in my usual size on my wedding feeling beautiful and happy.

I got really excited thinking maybe he thinks I'm cute too? Then one day he says to me, in class, that I need to shave my legs. I was devastated, and went home after school crying to my mother about what he said. My Mom started taking me to wax appointments after that. Years later, I'm dating a guy in my early twenties. We're staring sweetly into each other's eyes, and he says to me ""you should pluck your eyebrows"". 

Eventually, I gave up on my looks altogether. My Mom was more critical of my looks than anyone else in my life. My aunt, my grandma, also pointed out my flaws and made me feel bad for not doing enough to fix them. I sometimes think I got fat on purpose as a fuck you to them and all the men that made me feel less than them, because I don't really want to look the way I used to.

I was raised in the 70's, for some reason my mom didn't make healthy eating a big deal, she just never bought the bad  stuff. I didn't get shamed about my body from her or learned it in the home, was never put on a diet. and was an athletic kid. 

But I did see a lot of body shaming at school, in the media, in my group of friends. Saw them on diets. 

Where I got the most pressure was in the dance studio and from other women, particularly in adulthood as their bodies became less fit and I retained my fitness. I've always been an athlete, always exercised. always liked healthy food though sugar, that's my drug of choice.

As I've kept up exercise and a healthy lifestyle, others my age haven't; now I'm some kind of weirdo/unicorn? Seems funny to me. And especially when I go to the US south and midwest I get unwelcomed comments like, ""you're so skinny"". Um, no, I'm height-weight proportionate you dimwit. Others are not accustomed to seeing that in women my age, which I think is linked to their own disordered eating and body images.

I have watched calories a few times in my life but in both occasions I was starting to over indulge and wasn’t feeling well. exercise and not over doing the sweets brought me back to feeling fit - and I stop.

I’m not anxious necessarily to date, have guests over, share meals with others, stuff like that - honestly most of the people I spend my time with are in the same line of work and we’re almost all a bit batty in the head with food so I’m pretty normal in that regard, and most of us are very aware of that and we discuss it/bodies/diets/etc. as a frequent topic of conversation.

I always got her old clothes to wear. My mother being aware of my sisters condition did not end this. This really fucked me up. I couldn't fit, at least comfortably, in my older sister's stuff. But I was expexted to.

My mother also made comments about me eating to much since I can remember. So, slowly but surely I started eating in secret. Using sweets to make me feel better.

After I moved out, I gained 30 pounds. No diet would stick. It has been over the past two years that I have finally managed to lose weight long term - when I stopped trying. I focussed on doing sport that made me feel good. On eating healthy but to the point I was full.

I starved my entire adult life, 40 years of being hungry and feeling like it was MY fault.   
  
If I just ate intuitively and listened to my body, I'd be naturally lean.  
  
Log and weigh every bite for the rest of your life. 

If I just stopped at 80% or ""satisfied not full"" I'd be naturally at a healthy weight.  
  
If I went to therapy. Moved more. Ate less. CICO. Exercise more. Build muscle. Do cardio / don't do cardio... move more. Eat small meals 6 times / day. Eat one meal and fast in between. Make sure you have breakfast. Don't eat before 4pm. Eat more fat. Eat more carb. Eat more meat. Don't eat fat, carb, meat, sugar...

Love my body, accept my body no matter what. Even if that means being overweight or obsessive.

There is not one thing on this list that helped or worked like a GLP1.

I did, or do, still find some of those concepts useful, because I have realized the extent to which I have used food to try to cope with trauma, depression, and anxiety. Knowing that didn't enable me to successfully deal with that behavior or lose weight, but observing it did actually make me more aware of my emotional patterns. 

And now Zepbound is here to help me actually do something with all the stuff about psychology, nutrition, exercise, cooking, dealing with pressure from others to eat, etc., etc.that I learned over the years! It's amazing, and I do think medical professionals should learn about these drugs for the sake of their patients and because the science is just interesting, and let go of the whole ""willpower"" narrative. 

And the whole world needs to get over its hatred of obese people, especially of women--but I don't think that hatred is where *all* of the ""change how you think about food"" stuff comes from.",1ijttfp,mbh97ys,2025-02-07 14:03:43

"The “relationship with food” narrative is a scam, and we have been gaslit for years","I've been entirely unable to mend in this manner. It's not helpful. It's like telling a heroin addict to mend their relationship with substances. Even with diet, exercise, etc. I never was able to remain in the state I'm in now -- food is just food, a necessary thing. I regularly forget to eat - it's not on my mind. I've been on Metformin since 2009 (stopped for baby #1/2, remained on it for baby #3) and I've literally not experienced what I experience now. 

Before Zep, I rode the blood sugar rollercoaster because I'm insulin resistant. The two hormones this drug targets made a 180° change -- my A1C even dropped by a tenth of a point and the lowest it's ever been is 5.6; I'm back to 5.9 which is where I was years ago.

Felt the same thing yesterday, even though I know that I now don't look overweight to other drivers, as if they were even caring about what I'm doing to begin with.

I pretty much only like plain things-classic white/yellow/beige eating. I have texture and taste issues. I desperately wished I liked vegetables but I don't. 

I HATE cooking. I hate figuring out what to eat. I hate having to go grocery shopping.  I hate that I'm almost always the one cooking because my partner also hates cooking and says I'm the picky one and he says it's too hard to cook for one person. 

I love sugar and even if their is some slightly healthy easy snack option like already cut fruit around, i would still pass right over for a baked good or snack cake.

"My therapist said the #1 thing her ADHD clients seek help for is food. So, what’s your relationship with food like?","i've also read a few books on the topic and something else that REALLY rang true for me was the notion that the act of eating itself, in this context, is a ritual we enact to feel a sense of control over SOMETHING in a world that we otherwise feel we have zero control over. choosing to eat. choosing not to eat. eating specific things that have a predictable outcome/feeling. it's something we cling to for a sense of agency and self-determination that we don't feel anywhere else in our lives. our lives that feel otherwise so thoroughly out of our control.

and, of course, eating (especially if it's inextricably linked to a bunch of emotional baggage, do NOT even get me started jfc) gives you a nice big shot of dopamine, which we are already critically difficient in. or choosing not to eat either gives you a shot of adrenaline from willfully defying what you're supposed to do, or a nice big serotonin shot when you are able to let go of the fear/anxiety of having to prepare something. or alternaatively gives you the same boost for completing a compulsive routine, which was more my thing on this. and so the cycle begets itself.",1c6u8e8,l03qxrq,2024-04-18 05:30:59

Quitting has been sooooooo incredibly helpful with having a more even level of energy and not having the mood downswings I would get coming down off sugar that would then drive the sugar cravings that made me feel helpless to stop the cycle from starting all over again.

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"I have found this to be true. I am an American who moved to the Netherlands. While I’m not arguing Europe is a magical weight loss drug, I have lost 96 pounds so far living here. For mostly the reasons you mentioned: food isn’t meant to be convenience. 

I definitely have to count my calories like everyone else here, but I have noticed differences when I go home to the US to visit. I’m shocked by how fast a meal in a restaurant is. I drive by fast food restaurants wherever I go. Here, they exist, but I would have to go out of my way to get to the McDonalds that’s near me. When I lived in America, the only road to my apartment had a row of fast food restaurants to drive by, thus necessitating the internal question of “should I just pick up a burger, or should I cook at home?” 

Restaurants give smaller portions, but even beyond that, DRINK portions are smaller. A weird adjustment I had to make was sitting through a (long!) european restaurant meal, and sipping my Diet Coke slowly. If you order one, you’re getting 12oz, and that’s it until your food arrives (at which point you can order another drink to have with the meal). I have a friend who calls America “The land of the free... ...refills”, and honestly, i think it’s really funny.  I do miss big drinks (and that sweet, sweet, free giant glass of water you can get in any American restaurant) next to your drink, if you want it. You can, of course, through some directed and specific questions to your server get free water here, but it’s a tiny glass (like, slightly larger than the size of a paper cup a hospital would give you to swallow a pill), and they are not going to be happy to keep refilling it. 

Over and above restaurants, one thing I really think helps with eating saner portions/having a healthier relationship to food, is how the grocery stores allow you to buy vegetables (etc) in normal quantities. Buying vegetables doesn’t have to be a 2 pound bag of lettuce that’s just going to rot and go bad. If you just need one carrot for the dish you’re making, you can buy a single carrot. My local grocery stores also make little ingredient boxes: want to make pea soup? Cool, here’s a box with peas, an onion, soup mix, and a few cloves of garlic. Interested in risotto? Same deal, there’s a box that has the chopped-up veggies you need, some rice, mushrooms, and a lil’ cheese. It’s genuinely awesome. There’s no comparison to American-style “cooking boxes” like Hamburger Helper (which is a box of pasta and various salt-based flavorings).

The differences between American and European food culture seem to me to be a macrocosm of the age-old dieter’s dilemma: do I want a LOT of something, or a small, VERY tasty  amount of it? America, in my experience, just blindly goes for quantity over quality. An American restaurant would be more likely give you a gigantic mixing bowl full of iceberg lettuce (because it looks huge and green) where a corresponding european restaurant salad would be much smaller—the size of an actual salad plate, but with an interesting medley of lettuces, and maybe some nuts/fruits/whatever studded throughout. 

I also think you pointed out another really important difference: price points. It is not appreciably cheaper here to make unhealthy, shelf-stable choices at the grocery store. Vegetables are affordable; you can buy them one at a time (no one is sending you home with 2 pounds of tomatoes when you just wanted to buy one to slice on top of your burger). Vegetarian meat substitutes are totally normal here, and, with some exceptions (imported things, like the impossible burger), are around the same price as their meat counterparts. I feel like in America making the commitment to eat healthy, fresh foods is also a commitment to shopping at Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, or whatever the upscale grocery store nearest you is. Sure, places like Walmart have vegetables, but they never look particularly fresh or end up being particularly good (source: did my groceries at a Walmart for many years before moving here). I often look at the Dutch versions of American people standing in the checkout lines, and am completely amazed. The tired construction worker, still in his high-viz is often buying the ingredients for a killer-looking spinach based pasta dish. That is to say, there appears to be a decoupling between the American attitude of “big tough men gotta eat big tough things” and the associated piles of frozen sausage biscuits and bags of Doritos at the checkout counter. People here, of all walks of life and gender, make more reasonable food decisions. Maybe it’s cultural, maybe it’s Maybelline. Who knows. 

All of that is not to say that the Dutch are perfect paragons of health. Their national breakfast food is chocolate sprinkles on top of buttered bread (hagelslag, yo). They have some places, especially around train stations, where it’s easy to find and buy the convenience-food eat-as-you-walk stuff. Every city has at least one “wall” of fried snacks, which works kind of like a vending machine: you put a euro in and get a stick of deep fried gravy (or, as the Dutch would call it “a kroket”). But I think the difference here is you just get one, and that seems to be enough for people. I’ve done the calorie counting, and eaten my share of wall-kroketjes. They’re like 250 calories. The American Value Version(TM) would be giving you 3 kroketten, a side of fries, and half a liter of coke. 

Anyway, this is getting long. But I have experienced this first hand, and I think moving here is how I was able to reverse a lifetime of obesity. To all my American friends still out there, figuring out wtf to do with the 2 pound bag of carrots you needed to buy, just because you wanted to add some julienned carrots to your salad at lunch, I see you, and I am impressed with your creative meal-preps to use up those ingredients. You’re fighting the good, fight, and I am proud of you. 

And, to all the Europeans who are reading this, who struggle with their weight, I see you too. Even if the portions are smaller, it is SO easy to eat a few hundred calories more than you should in a day. It’s easy to gain a little weight. And I know you’re all logging and keeping up the good fight too. I am proud of you, too. 

Anyway, I’m going to end this ramble here. I’m happy to answer questions about American/European food culture, to the best of my ability.",drvyh0,f6lffx4,2019-11-05 08:19:09

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"I think this is super interesting because I've never been to the U.S. (in Northern Europe myself) and I don't always understand the whole picture. So this post will probably negate all my ""good advice"" now lol!

&nbsp;

For me it's totally natural that 

* I rarely eat in restaurants, 

    because it's super expensive to eat out, and it takes a long time to go there, sit and wait for the food to arrive (maybe half an hour of sitting down and talking), you don't really get that much food anyway but it costs 10 times as much as cooking at home in a fraction of the time.

* I rarely eat at fast food restaurants.

    because there are none in the town centre anyway, and definitely none in the village where I live. There is one McDonalds and one Burger King in town, but they are pretty far away from the center of town next to a supermarket / near the main road. Also their food isn't very tasty, yuk. I'm used to fresh food.

* I rarely buy premade foods or frozen meals.

    because as you say, 80% of the store is ingredients for meals. And the premade foods taste bad.

    Premade foods have increased though. I've seen these silly things in the store, like ""pizza kits"", it's a premade dough, already rolled out... and a pouch of oily, weird tomato sauce. I got some for free and tried it and the dough tasted terrible. I had to cover it with loads of toppings and cheese to hide the dough flavor. *Why?*

    When I make pizza, I pour some water in a bowl, add yeast, salt, oil and flour, knead it, and wait for 30 minutes. I don't usually buy it anywhere because the pizzas you buy just don't taste very good. Hence I don't eat pizza super often either.

* I eat a lot of vegetables and fruit.

    There are lots of fresh ingredients in stores and it's usually the first thing you see when you enter the store. In our local store the vegetables and fruit are right inside the door. Everyone needs to get their potatoes and onions and other staples so...

* I use my bike to go to the store.

    I could drive, but we only have one car and I don't usually drive it much. I'll take the train, bus, bike, or walk where I am going. Taking the car just feels like a hassle, you have to park it and all that kind of stuff lol. You can take your bike on the train if need be.

&nbsp;

This isn't because I'm super healthy, it's mostly because of how society is here. I might be eating less premade foods because I like cooking and try to keep it healthy, and don't live in a big city with access to a lot of convenience food.

&nbsp;

Eating *while* driving seems insane and dangerous, eating food *while* working seems like you can't enjoy the food. Idk. I prefer to eat and enjoy, then do something else.

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"N.b., marginally means not very much. 

Also (American here, living in Barcelona for 18 years), I think you're presenting a viewpoint from a limited perspective. In dense American cities the parking and availability of fast food is pretty much the same as in dense European cities. Are you from a small town? 

The truth is I don't see that big a difference. The supermarkets in Europe (or at least Spain, UK, Netherlands, and Greece where I have experience) are going through the same changes US supermarkets have gone through in the past - processed foods, prepared meals, lots more snacks than they had 18 years ago when I moved here. 

All of this leads to my own conclusion: when I spend time back in the US, even though I'm making up for lost time with BBQ and Combos and Cap´n Crunch, and Panera and Noah's and Popeyes (sooo much Popeyes), I lose weight. Every time. I just got back from a 20-day trip to California and am down 2,5kg. I'm not sure why this is, but I have a theory that since I have to make a lot of the things I like/miss here in Spain, I have more quantity available. In the US I can buy a brownie pretty much anywhere. Here I have to make brownies, and we ALL know how long a pan of brownies is going to last in my house...",drvyh0,f6lqyv9,2019-11-05 12:48:09

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"I'm an American who has lived both in Ireland and in South Korea. Just want to share my experience, cause I definitely think this is true.

In Ireland, I didn't have a car and I did lose weight. A lot of it I did gain back by the end of my time there though; I was a student drinking beer all the time and munching on nutella toast writing papers.

Korea is where I dropped weight like no one's business. There were multiple open air markets with fresh produce, meat, baked goods, etc. I had a second floor walk up apartment and a second floor walk up classroom.  Those little coffees were popular, and full of sugar, but so tiny compared to what you would get in America.  Yes, there were convenience stores and you could get unhealthy food like ramen or fried chicken; or kimbap, or bibimbap, (rice and veggies, maybe lean meat or fish).  Hiking, even in the city was a hugely popular activity; I would routinely  take the subway to achasan for a hike, or ride my bike along the han river. Going out to eat you would get barbeque, which in korea consists of fresh meat, rice, kimchi and other pickled veggies.  Or soup. Or bibimbap. Even going out for unhealthy food balanced out when you were walking there to get it. Honestly, I think the single biggest thing was just not having a car; in most parts of America, not having a car is very difficult.",drvyh0,f6lq0gp,2019-11-05 12:31:58

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"Here in Europe and especially Eastern Europe we have another problem. We tell people they are fat when they are not even close to being even slightly overweight. My whole family used to discuss Shakira in her Wherever Whenever video and saying she was a fat and how dare she show herself. Same with Rihanna, and freaking I shop at the Children's Section Selena Gomez which came from a friend of mine. 

My BMI was 23. Not good. Not terrible but still in the healthy range. I was made to feel like I am freaking 600 pounds morbidly obese. Everyone was saying how I was morbidly obese. My doctor was freaking saying it until they actually measured me and were surprise I wasn't anywhere near morbidly obese. Any woman with a BMI above 20 was a fat cow or thought of herself like that. Don't you dare wear shorts in the summer you fat pig! But also haha haha isn't it pathetic that this fat pig needs to wear jeans in summer to hide her legs? 

In Eastern Europe the expectations of female beauty are above and beyond. Also shaving is bad, you either laser or wax.

\> $5 quickly made pizzas are on every block.

Where do you live in the US? This is not the case anywhere where I have lived. Berlin is a major, cosmopolitan city, so you should be comparing it to our biggest, most cosmopolitan cities. It's not a fair comparison if you're comparing it to the burbs.

I live in Chicago and tons of restaurants don't have parking - that is life in the city. I have lived here for over 12 years and haven't had a car in that time - I walk and take public transit.

There are lots of ""ethnic"" grocery stores that are similar to the ones you describe - you don't have to go to the big supermarkets or Walmart if you don't want to (I have rarely ever been in a Walmart). A few miles away from me there is actually German grocery store, not to mention all sorts of Asian marts, Trader Joe's (which is awesome), Aldi (which is German), etc.

Yes, there are lots of unhealthy options, but you can be as healthy as you want to be.

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"> DRINK portions are smaller.

This reminded me, I like to watch Twitch streams sometimes. The first time I saw someone drinking (coke or something) I stared at it - it was like he was drinking it from a bucket. It looked so ridiculously oversized. I wondered how his bladder could even hold all of that.

&nbsp;

>And, to all the Europeans who are reading this, who struggle with their weight, I see you too. Even if the portions are smaller, it is SO easy to eat a few hundred calories more than you should in a day. It’s easy to gain a little weight.

When I reflect on it - I have no idea why / how I was overweight in the first place.

But ... I am short, my TDEE is low. I was never active in the past. I liked to eat sweets. Baked goods with coffee, not just one. Bake and eat all of it over a few days. Use cream in homemade food. Eat too much of it.

If I had grown up like many others here, I would probably have ballooned up to 400 lbs minimum with my old ways - here I reached about 90 kg. Still almost twice as big as I needed to be. I know people who are 100-160 kg.

I feel a serious disconnect with this sub sometimes. It seems so geared towards the super obese who need to lose 100+ pounds. For me, the idea to even get to the point of being *that* obese is so foreign.. I mean: HOW do you get to be 300+ lbs? It would be damn difficult to get that big in a country like the Netherlands, considering the food convenience infrastructure and related culture simply isn't there. 

I think for many EU based people, the struggle is much more about tweaking already existing *decent* eating habits to *structurally* cut out several 100s kcal to lose 10-60 pounds instead of just doing 1200 kcal/day to *lose* the weight. Theres plenty of obese people around, don't get me wrong, but on the streets I see very few people who need to lose more than 60 pounds.

It's just a very different kind of journey that requires different strategies and thought patterns than when you start out on a 100+ pound weight loss journey. Its no longer about learning how to cook, walking/biking more often, incorporating veggies and fruits in your diet, and cutting sweets and fast food..

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"It’s so easy to become overweight. That’s been the big lesson I’ve been learning all along. Unlike some of the folks here struggling with binging, that was never me. I just ate a little too much for too long, and it all added up. Now that I have been eating a little less for a long time, it has added up too. There are fat people here in Europe (though fewer than in America), and I don’t judge them harshly. Inactivity and too much cream in your coffee adds up, no matter what color your passport is. 

I often wonder if I would have been as big as I was (127kg at the highest) if I grew up here in Europe, and I don’t think I would have. I mean, I am aware it’s an impossible comparison— there are way too many variables. But, I am seeing that “bigger is better” was a very location-dependent concept. And that living in a healthier (well, a less obviously overweight one, at least) society was enough to get me to at least be willing to try to change. I’m just a normal person at the end of the day: I want to fit in, and feel like I belong. And feeling like I fit in was not possible at the weight I was at. I still don’t feel like I fit in, but I do know I’m making progress. And yeah, weight loss has helped, but so has time, and language-learning, and good ol’ experience of just living here.",drvyh0,f6lif8k,2019-11-05 09:39:32
[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"You definitely need to be seriously dedicated in the United States to get to 400-600 lbs as well. It's not like, culturally normal or acceptable in the U. S. to be that large. I think it's just easier to get to a certain weight and keep going. Our culture allows, if not DEMANDS, it. We are in a huge rush all the time. We don't take breaks, we don't take vacations, we don't take time off, we don't take sick days. 

We need our food fast, convenient, and unhealthy; and if not, we need to fight, spend more money, and navigate/create an unusual lifestyle by American standards to make it healthy, portion controlled, 

I don't usually watch shows about food and weight but I did watch a short and interesting documentary about metabolism and being overweight. Once a certain weight is reached and the diets begin (the cycle of lifelong yo-yo dieting so many of us follow), our metabolism literally slows down and stops producing fat-burning hormone known as Leptin. We have to work harder and harder, eat less and exercise even more, just to lose weight, and to maintain the weight loss we have to be in an even greater calorie deficit than a person who has been a normal weight her whole life...

I think that that scientific information accounts for a huge part of the reason so many Americans struggle to lose and maintain a normal weight.",drvyh0,f6m6sai,2019-11-05 15:25:55
[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,">  I remember going to a Trader Joe's in the US and being shocked at the prices.

I found the prices in US supermarkets shocking as well. First I thought its just because it was Whole Foods, then I thought it was just because it was in NYC, but then I went to some low-rent place in Virginia and it was *still* hugely more expensive than food in the UK.

Not even good food though. Like a 100g packet of mechanically recovered reformed ham was about $5. In the UK, that would be £1.....",drvyh0,f6llyft,2019-11-05 11:11:43

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"I have heard these figures before, from u/mostly_plants, who is an excellent Dutch person (and who has also lost a bunch of weight).

The first fact doesn’t surprise me, because I think the  Dutch people who are overweight are less likely to cross the threshold into obesity (as compared to Americans who are overweight). Thus, it keeps the numbers of overweight people high. I have just recently crossed into the overweight (from obese) category myself, and, in my own experience, there is a HUGE difference between the two categories. 

Importantly, the “overweight” range is about 30 pounds above a normal body weight. There is no upper bound on the obese range. It’s a bigger category. 

I can only speculate as to the reason why Dutch people remain overweight (and don’t become obese)— as I mentioned in my first comment, Dutch food isn’t particularly health-promoting (lots of fried things, potatoes, hagelslag on the morning toast, etc). But, there is something to be said about the relative population density here, and associated uptick in walking/cycling/using public transportation as opposed to driving.",drvyh0,f6lyis1,2019-11-05 14:22:04
[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"right? we have plenty of overweight people but just not in the same magnitude as you see in America, for example I couldn't imagine anyone here getting a scootmobile for no other reason than being to heavy to walk, like unless you'd want to pay for that fully out of your own pocket, even then people will just ask you what's wrong with you and respond with ""shouldn't you be walking more then?"".  
My top weight was around 110kg (27F 172cm tall), I think that if I'd let myself go for a couple more years that might've possibly increased to 150, but beyond that I'd have to put in some serious effort to gain more weight here.

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"I think there are tons of other reasons too that Americans are fatter, and I don't think any of it is because people are lazy. If anything it might be because they are *not* lazy?

&nbsp;

* You get a driver's license when you're 16, here it's 18. (I was like 21 when I got mine, was in no rush.) I guess people start driving when they are 15.  And then everyone gets a car, or someone has to drive them around until they can get a car of their own.

* Poverty. Food quality suffers, the fast food industry preys on the poor. If there wasn't a flavor industry making the ground up/boiled to death meats taste like heaven, nobody would be able to swallow fast food. It's not good quality food. It just tastes good because of science. It makes you want to eat more because it is engineered to be addictive.

* Violence? So many people seem scarred from something that happened to them earlier in life. Leading them to try to eat the pain away.

* Drugs? Everyone seems to be taking drugs, getting the munchies. Nobody I know uses drugs.

* No time. You guys have like 2-3 jobs and study too. No wonder you have to eat while doing other things. Here people don't usually have jobs to pay their way through school (university is free, all we have to pay for is books). I don't know anybody who has two jobs. We have time to make dinner.

* Your healthcare costs a lot. So again you have to have multiple jobs. Here healthcare is basically free.

* Resistance to legislation. I remember when Jamie Oliver was trying to get American schools to stop giving chocolate milk to kids, or introduce a tax on sugary drinks. Massive, massive resistance. Even from parents. Here there is more legislation, many countries have a sugar tax etc.

* When corn was subsidized Americans invented high-fructose corn syrup and started adding that to everything. Cheaper and worse-for-you ""sugar"".

American advertising normalizes an abnormally unhealthy relationship with food.,"Same goes for alcohol. I recently saw an add for ""portable premium cocktails"" to ""take on your next adventure""...as if hiking in the woods is something you should be doing while chugging canned margaritas. The idea of being active and then drinking alcohol as a ""reward"" is so common and so normalized by advertisements. When I first started going to the gym I would drink hard ciders right after and basically cancel out any benefits with a bunch of sugary alcohol that dehydrated me, made my sleep patterns hell, and kept me from losing weight.

The thing is most people would say either with the Reeses or the cocktails that it's puritanical to deny yourself the ""reward"" sometimes but there's just way too much of it out there. You can get candy, chips, fast food, flavored coffee, beer etc etc every two steps in a major city and even outside that there's always delivery or Amazon.  

I think once you start being more aware your choices are less zombie-fied and more drawn to choose what your body needs to feel good.

I have kids. I have ice cream or candy when they are asleep even though it's forbidden for them, especially in the evenings. And yes, they walked on me eating more than once. 

Rules for kids are not rules for adults, simple as. Do the kid ask to drink coffee or wine? Can the kid watch TV before bedtime? Can she stay awake later at night? I don't think so. You can easily teach your children that no, they are not your equals and that rules for them don't necessarily apply to you. 

Once they are your age they can decide to eat ice cream and candy and even fries every meal if they so chose. But for now, they are growing up, sugar is not healthy for a growing body, and her parents are responsible for her health. When she's older she'll be responsible for her own health and then and only then will she be able to do unhealthy choices for herself.

I'm also not sure why the brother and his family are staying with OP, but if it's because they need a place to stay: is this really worth risking their temporary housing over?

Does anyone else feel like calorie counting messed up their relationship with food?,"Yes, this was my experience. Through calorie counting I was able to lose about 30lbs in just over half a year which got me down to a healthy BMI, however, it became an obsession and all I could think about. 


By the end it practically led me into eating disorder territory, and then after I realised I had to stop for my mental health, all of the weight piled back on in less than a year - I realised I hadn't actually *learned* anything about how to eat normally, how to eyeball portions, how to listen to my body's signals etc, because I had been 100% relying on the calculator to make all my decisions for me. 


Stupidly, this wasn't enough of a cue for me to realise calorie counting wasn't right for me - so I tried again a couple years later. I thought this time I'll pay more attention to my body, portions etc so that I actually learn useful skills. But it didn't happen like that. Again, I lost all the weight, again it became an obsession verging on an ED, and again I put all of the weight back on immediately after I had to stop counting. 



For me personally, the only solution was to seek other methods of weight loss that didn't involve calorie counting. I am happy to say that in 2022 I lost all the weight again, this time without calorie counting, it was much easier on my mental health and it's been 3 years and I haven't put it back on. 


I didn't follow any specific diet or plan etc. I just focused on trying to eat as many vegetables as possible, and limiting calorific drinks and calorie dense foods (but without counting/measuring - just making swaps eg eating fruit for a snack instead of chips, swapping full fat mayo for light mayo and consciously using less of it). ",1m3t1qz,n3z8cv2,2025-07-19 11:24:31

Counting calories can be hard, but for me, being unhappy in an overweight body was much harder. Because I thought about my weight EVERY day. It upset me every single day. Now it doesn’t.",1m3t1qz,n3z6wne,2025-07-19 11:13:16

Does anyone else feel like calorie counting messed up their relationship with food?,"Yes, this very much is an issue for me too.  It wasn’t at first.  At first, tracking was very good at teaching me the nutrient density of foods, appropriate serving sizes, how eating protein at breakfast was setting myself up for a more solid day with less grazing, etc.  But after years of tracking, now I run into a few problems.  

1. I can’t help but tracking even when I am talking to my teenage kids about their food.  “Be mindful—that bagel is 300kcal plus the cream cheese, so that’s about 450kcal.” Not cool.  I dont want my kids to have to think about their food in terms of kcal.  Sure, yes, good to discern beneficial foods from those that are less nutritious, but seeing food only in terms of it’s macros and kcal value isn’t life.

2. Once I have logged it, I feel compelled to finish eating it even if I get satisfied.  And half the time I don’t even know I am satisfied.  I wouldn’t know how much I was throwing away or giving to a teenage kid in the house to finish for me, so my count would be off.  If it’s logged and I start eating it, by golly, Im finishing it and usually with a spatula to finish the bowl because the majority of my logging stems around weight loss and every calorie I can get, I want.  

3. For me, a gentle deficit would be around 1700-1800kcal.  I actually have a MUCH harder time losing weight now, after years of tracking, because before I would just cut out dessert and eat smaller portions, no tracking involved, and I was probably eating close to 1200-1500kcal a day when I did that.  And weight would come off pretty easily.  Now, with tracking, if I try and do that I will get to the end of the day, see I only had 1400kcal and KNOW that its pretty low and that my gentle deficit has me at 1700kcal so I don’t undercut my metabolism, so I eat a late night snack to get to 1700kcal, feel happy I did that at night, and then goodness, weight loss is SO SLOW.  

So yes, tracking has really messed up my head with my own relationship with food.  I have considered stepping away from tracking on an app and only writing own on paper what I eat, then after a week or two, add it to the app to see what those two weeks looked like.",1m3t1qz,n3z5rt0,2025-07-19 11:04:12

"The “relationship with food” narrative is a scam, and we have been gaslit for years","The other fallacy in the ""relationship with food"" theory is that we were told that if we healed that relationship, we'd view food as strictly fuel for our bodies, problem solved.

"The “relationship with food” narrative is a scam, and we have been gaslit for years","I think the problem is that **excess weight** and obesity aren’t the same thing even though we’ve made them synonymous for practically forever. People carry excess weight for lots and lots of reasons. You can carry excess weight without a metabolic disorder like obesity. The interventions need to be different because the people are different and the causes are different. I’m with you - I clearly just didn’t have enough glp1 (maybe also gip) in my body. That’s it plain and simple. The day after my first dose my body felt like it exhaled in a sigh of relief I never imagined was possible and it fixed everything for me. There is no relationship to fix. I would consider myself to have done very little mental work - I had to build a habit of stopping with less than I thought I wanted and then pausing to see if I was satisfied, but now that’s a habit it’s not a big mental load. But I don’t think that’s true for everyone. There are people who have no coping skills outside of food. Those folks really struggle and the drug isn’t the (necessarily only) fix for them. There are people who might have something else wrong that a glp1 agonist doesn’t impact. Those people aren’t getting the same world changing experience I did. 

So I think the real problem is that for so long in our society excess weight only had one cause (and society was wrong ): moral failing. It’s your fault for having these problems, not being strong enough, building this bad relationship. There’s no failure on the part of anyone carrying excess weight. At the same time, there are people carrying that weight who do need to develop new ways of moving in the world with food, and the relationship language might work for them. So I don’t begrudge them that or think it’s gaglighting. I just think it was the only thing we had for a long time so it was being given to all of us whether that was the thing we needed or not.",1ijtqmq,mbgvobk,2025-02-07 12:38:53

"The “relationship with food” narrative is a scam, and we have been gaslit for years","I don’t really agree with this take. Multiple things can be true at once. For example having a screwed up mindset around food AND the biological hunger signaling being off physiologically, which for me is true. 

The other entity doesn’t need to be a person for a relationship to form. It’s a metaphorical definition of relationship, meaning one’s feelings and attitudes around food, not a literal one. 

My feelings and attitudes around food are indeed disordered and yes, therapy for eating disorder has helped me address them. Taking a GLP1 doesn’t magically make all that go away for most people with disordered relationship to food. Like I’d be very full, no physical cravings bc of GLP1, & yet at times I still have the urge to rely on excess food to soothe my emotions. It feels like a real craving, my mouth waters and everything, bc it’s ingrained in me as a viable way of self soothing from childhood. 

GLP1s are one part of the puzzle for many of us. They address the physiological issues of feeling overly hungry for no physical or emotional reason. But to say that’s all it is just isn’t true for many many people who have dieted and gained and dieted and gained over and over again, or who have struggled with binging or confusion around food. Yes, it is one’s internal attitudes and thoughts around food that complete the puzzle for many people, and addressing those will result in a more complete recovery from disordered eating for them, that doesn’t hinge solely on a medication that only addresses half of it. 

If that’s not your experience, that’s not your experience. I’m sure there are some people out there whose food issues are completely addressed by the medication. But there are many, many of us with disordered relationship to food, and equating your experience as if it’s the only truth isn’t helpful to everyone else and is invalidating. ",1ijtqmq,mbguq9t,2025-02-07 12:32:07

It is odd that the reasons your parents gave for not being allowed to blame Amy were the same reasons that they used to say you can't blame them because it is Amy's fault.

Amy is in need of psychological help to stop binge eating. Food is an addiction that can not be cut out of your life because the body needs it to survive. Drugs, smoking, and alcohol can be avoided to remove temptation, but food can not.

Encourage your sister to get help. Everyone being kind and understanding will kill her.",1l2j2zu,mvtk2un,2025-06-03 19:06:19

AITA for blowing up at my parents for something my adult sister did?,"NTA. Your sister needs therapy, and so do your parents. She needs help, and they need to stop enabling her.   Before she gets worse. And the older she gets, the harder it'll be for her to make the necessary changes to improve her life. 

You don't say if she's struggling with her weight or not, but what you described is exactly the situation seen on literally every episode of ""My 600lb Life"" - person turns to food for comfort as a child, whoever they are currently living with enables them, and they slowly get to the point of losing mobility and being in very ill health, and quite a few of them end up eating themselves to death. The successful ones largely get therapy and push through and do the hard work. The ones with the enablers who won't stop feeding them are the ones more likely to die.

Even if that's not her situation, she still needs therapy and treatment. And your parents need to stop enabling her and making excuses for her. 

Since your sister apologized and felt bad, I'd probably not totally cut contact with her, especially if you feel she might be willing to try and get help... having someone supportive who isn't cooking for her might be a great thing. Your parents though? That's tough. I'd say let them stay silent as long as they want, you did nothing wrong, and they are doing nothing to help your sister from what you've shared.

She obviously knows she has a problem she can't control,  and she was the only one apologizing. Why wasn't that conversion with her?

AITA for “forcing” my wife to eat,"Hi OP:

I'm being vulnerable when I say this so people try to be kind. I've never admitted to having an ED, but I'm not stupid. I know I have some kind of issue surrounding eating/ morphed view on it. I'm not proud of it and know better.

Your wife sounds similar to me, even around the same age I'm 30. She knows what she is doing and is doing it both consciously and subconsciously. I can't tell you why she is doing it, everyone has their own ""issue""/ reason for starting this vicious cycle. Personally for me, mine started with my depression. It gave me no desire to eat, food had no taste, appetite or take care of myself in general. Once I got my depression kind of under control, I still deal with it, it was kind of like my food issue was now ""set in stone"". I put quotes around it because of course it's not, I'm the one still making it like that. 

You're NTA for ""forcing"" her to eat but it's not going to work. She on her own needs to make the choice and decision that SHE WANTS to change and help herself. I know that's really upsetting and painful to hear, but it's the truth. 

The more you push, the more you "" force"" .... The more secretive and hard she is going to work to hide the food from you , skip even more meals/ the small snacks she is actually eating, or run four hours instead of three.

I'm not saying you should pretend like nothing is happening or say absolutely nothing, that would be neglectful and uncaring. It's a hard spot understand...I mean my boyfriend would definitely understand what you are going through. He definitely knows I have some kind of disordered eating and struggles with it and tries his damn best to be helpful and supportive without being overbearing and pushy. He's amazing at it and I love him dearly for it. But I know at the beginning I was snarky and defensive about his subtle ways of trying to help. 

Some ways subtle ways he helps: 

1. He makes dinner for himself but will make me a plate and say "" I made you a plate for whenever you want it"" - takes the pressure off of feeling like I have to eat right then and there or you will be offended otherwise. It also takes away the pressure of having to eat in front of someone, giving the trust of "" I know you'll eat it at some point""
2. The plate he puts my food on is never this giant ass massive plate. It's a smaller sized plate- this takes away the immediate feeling I get of looking at food and feeling like "" that's a lot I can't eat all of that no way I'm finishing that plate""
3. Never comments or praises me for eating or finishing something, basically pretends like I didn't even eat- again takes away the pressure of feeling like someone is watching you eat and monitoring your every move. 
4. Never asks "" are you hungry?"" Or "" are you sure you aren't hungry?""- this will quite literally make me not eat longer
5. This one will seem silly or counterintuitive but... He will always ask do you want to go out to eat? I usually will say no and I bet your wife would as well. He will just say ok see you later. And he will go out by himself and get food, he rarely has left overs as he has an amazing appetite 🤣 but if he does they go in the fridge. Those leftovers can start looking prettttttyyyyyyy gooood sometimes. And also, it started to get lonely sitting there knowing he is out having a good time. So guess what ? I started joining him even if I didn't eat. That's a big step to be surrounded by all that food and not get crazy anxious.

I know some people will think he's babying me or going above and beyond but he's not. He literally just does it out of the kindness of his heart, and isn't annoyed in any way shape or form. He has helped me improve slowly but surely. And like I said I'm aware I have a problem and am not proud.

So regardless of being in a healthy weight range, my brain is getting the good feels it wants because you can see my bones. To maintain that weight I have to eat like 500 calories a day AT MOST and exercise for hours a day. That's clearly not healthy and after about 8 months of that I get sick and crash out.

AITA for “forcing” my wife to eat,"Glennon Doyle has spoken about having an eating disorder so there may be some insight there.

I can’t imagine how difficult it will be but you’ve got to pretend that there’s nothing wrong (to a point). The more you push the harder she’ll resist. You’ve got to treat food as something necessary but not to be dwelled on, like brushing your teeth.

The end point is if she faints, or injures herself. That’s not normal and the ER may be necessary. 

It might work after a bit to try asking her to come sit with you while you eat so that you’re not alone, or while running errands on a Saturday, go to lunch. Tell her it’s fine if she’s not hungry, but you need to eat. If she doesn’t want to order anything, let it go. In my experience, don’t go somewhere like Five Guy’s. The intense meat/fat smell can be overwhelming. 

If you are a person who snacks, make a plate of healthy, nutrient dense snacks and put it in the refrigerator. She may slowly start to eat some off the plate or out of the container if it’s not easy for you to monitor it, or the container is big enough she wouldn’t eat all of it, which could be triggering. That way she’s getting some nutrition while you work on the mental health aspect. Examples: hummus, cheese, fruit and vegetables, chicken, nuts, whole grain crackers, turkey, yogurt and/or cottage cheese dips, whatever other healthy foods y’all like. 

I have major depression and the chaos in the world right now has exacerbated my issue. This is just to say that she may have had a more recent trigger that is causing whatever healthy control she had over her past issues to fail.

Anyone else have messed up relationships with food now?,"Your parents sound so much like my own... my dad did his best to make things better for us kids, and at the time he was our hero because she always stopped the abuse when he came home from work. 

At mealtimes my mum would sit opposite us, scrutinising our every movement and criticising the way we held our cutlery/chewed our food etc etc in her angry booming voice. I used to end every mealtime shaking like a leaf. 

But now as an adult I wonder why the hell he didn't stand up to her... he would come home to find us cowering in a corner of our ransacked bedroom with swollen red marks on our faces arms and legs... and she'd give him some lame excuse that we had been disobedient. He would then say 'I'll get them out from under your feet' and take us out for a few hours, usually involving something nice to eat in the car and then like you, hiding the evidence. 

So concequently as an adult I feel uncomfortable eating in front of people, especially if they're not eating themselves. In these situations I still find my hands shaking. I prefer to eat in private, usually stuffing my face as quick as I can.

I have done so much over my adult years to heal my wounds and discover the 'me' beneath the trauma but the eating thing is one of those residual reminders that I can't seem to shake.

Actually, my dad didn't take us out but the abuse stopped when he got home. For YEARS, I thought he didn't know but when I actually confronted them as an adult, he denied it was ever that bad.

Once I realized he knew about the abuse and chose to do nothing, it still took a while to process (because how could I have 2 parents that didn't love me or even care enough to protect us?)

Now I know he was as guilty as she was. And he is just a wimp that doesn't stand up to anyone. UGH

(I was in a relationship with a narc for a few years and this is exactly the way I was. No kids involved but I really hope I would have grown a back bone if there were). 

I often wonder if my mum would have turned out the way she did if someone in her life had actually stood up to her and called her out on her bullshit.

It's all about the meaning we make of it. When people start calorie tracking, sometimes they may start to associate their worth with the # of calories they eat, label entire days as ""good"" or ""bad"" based on just one number, etc.

Perhaps you have enough awareness OP of calories and nutrition content from tracking, so that you can trust yourself without it and focus on eating more intuitively. That being said, eating intuitively is very challenging if we're eating processed/ultraprocessed foods because they lack the same satiety factors that whole foods have.

Unless they're under medical supervision, that conversation should not be happening in that context. The way we frame calories to impressionable kids is so important.

Honestly looking back, it was just good parenting.

 what did affect me was being forced to eat whatever was made for dinner.  Mom knew certain things were absolutely no for me, like I didn't like ricotta cheese (still don't), but made them anyway.  But that's what was for dinner so I had to sit in shame until I picked apart enough lasagna to be considered done at the dinner table.

"Did you grow up in a household where you could be punished for going into the food, doing so at certain times, etcetera?

I also became ill with an autoimmune condition early on that caused me to lose a lot of weight, which necessitated my parents trying to force feed me after I was diagnosed and recovering to gain the weight back. The food choices were not palatable for a young kid and I was not hungry; being forced to eat elk meat and drink dehydrated milk resulted in tears and tantrums. I hid food from my plate in a kitchen drawer when they weren’t watching. Yes, of course it always got caught, there is no magical tunnel where said food would disappear to. Thought I was pretty clever at the time 🤭

On top of that, after my father passed away, my mother had a mental breakdown, developing OCD and hoarding behaviors, especially around food availability. She locked out cupboards, the freezer, and the refrigerator. Often times, in a depressive state, she wouldn’t come out of her bedroom to unlock anything for us to gain access. I learned pretty quickly how to pick them with a bobby pin to feed ourselves - with the detrimental effect of potentially receiving a beating for doing so. Sometimes we decided it wasn’t worth the abuse so just…didn’t…eat…at home. 

All that to say…yeah. I’m 50+. I can go all day not eating. I am TERRIBLY picky, don’t like meat, cheese or dairy and don’t eat much of it when I do - but have tried to be better about consuming it. I’m not overweight, I don’t hoard it, I just don’t… eat a lot. Two siblings are overweight, focusing mainly on highly processed foods.

AITAH for calling the ambulance for my co-worker even though I know she was kind of faking it?,"Canadian here. When I was a supervisor, I had an agent ""Lindsay"" that had episodes of dangerously low blood pressure, we called an ambulance both times. She was taken to a hospital both times, the EMTs checked her vitals and said they had to bring her in. Other agents let us know that Lindsay called them after work on those days and asked if they wanted to go shopping. We were told Lindsay was abusing medications, possibly to get out of work, possibly because she and her boyfriend were known drug users.

Then Lindsay had to pay for the ambulance rides, in order for our health insurance to cover them. She was out a signficant amount of money until she was reimbursed. It came out that she and her boyfriend (a fellow employee) had serious money problems. Her attendance and performance were not good. She would go home on the first day of her period, because she ""forgot"" when her cycle started and ""made a mess"".  I noticed that her cycle always started a week before mine, so I knew she was consistent. But a woman in her mid-twenties should be prepared for her period by that age.

My manager decided to give her a severance package and show her out the door. It was in the works when she handed in her resignation. She had no idea that she missed out on a severance package. I never told her when I ran into her years later. She was heavily pregnant and I could only hope she wasn't still abusing her body.",1kvxxp2,mudfqcd,2025-05-26 17:16:10

*cries in American*


A bottle of insulin should cost about $5 US. The insulin in the bottle itself costs a few cents. The bottling and packaging is so industrialized that it's just about a dollar per bottle.


The makers of insulin sold in the US were caught collaborating to price gouge, with bottles going from $20-30 to $200-600 in a year. 


The companies have cut back to around $30-50 and made big we're awesome PR noise about it. That's because they no longer need to make huge profits on insulin because the same companies are all now making billions on GLP-1 drugs, for which they are again price gouging. 


I believe in modern Western medicine but pharm companies suck.


P.S. someone is probably going to mention Walmart insulin. Their cheap insulin is an old formula which is dosed and works differently than newer insulin. There are dangers using it if you don't know how and switching insulins itself is difficult. Over 30 years with diabetes I've had to switch insulins 4 times and each was a 4-6 month nightmare.",1kvxxp2,muda877,2025-05-26 16:49:19

feeling faint and asking for food makes sense with malnutrition and low blood pressure. oop’s reasoning for the lady not being in dire financial straits is that oop can read her, but oop also decided that she was faking based on that, and oop claims there was actually something wrong. 

if she can’t afford food for whatever reason, her behaviour is financially shady but overall makes sense.

AITAH for calling the ambulance for my co-worker even though I know she was kind of faking it?,"Also in the US, and when I was younger, my sister used to have occasional fainting spells too (possibly like the woman OOP describes, she was struggling with an ED, luckily she is doing really well these days). She fainted at work a couple times and thinking back, I'm shocked they didn't call an ambulance. They just sat her on a bench and brought her a drink like OOP describes and then sent her home. But it was the 90s, I would imagine these days, they (it was a bank inside a grocery store) would be worried about liability and call for an ambulance.

A few years after that, I fainted at work. I worked at a dry cleaners and it was probably 100 degrees that day and it was hot as hell in there. I was standing at the counter, talking to a customer, and the next thing I know, I'm lying on the floor in the office (I imagine my coworkers dragged me in there? haha) with a fan pointed at me and a coworker tells me she's got the a/c blasting in my car and once I feel better, I should go home. All 3 of us were dumb college kids, no ""adult"" or manager was there. Looking back, I'm thinking, I'd be scared to put someone in their car/let them drive after just watching them pass out, haha. But again, late 90s, and young and dumb. 

As an adult who manages a team of people now, if I had an employee who was passed out, unless it was a situation where they had told me in advance that this was an issue and please don't call an ambulance ... I'm calling. Because what if I don't and it's something serious? I'm not taking any chances, not just due to liability but because I actually care about the people on my team. If they were conscious and asked me not to, I'd respect that, but I'd try to get them to let someone drive them instead. 

I've also had employees who feel sick whenever there's a deadline. And one who was always sick the day after a long weekend and couldn't come in. They'd email me at like 5 a.m. going, ""I'm sick, can't come in today,"" it was like clockwork every single time. I used to wonder if they scheduled the email in advance, haha. But if I had someone in the office who was constantly on a fainting couch, being fanned/tended to, I would probably have a discussion with HR on how we could sensitively handle this while maintaining the person's privacy/medical info but also minimizing the disruption to other people's work day. Because it's absurd that this is happening every 2 weeks and she's getting multiple coworkers involved/borrowing money left and right.",1kvxxp2,mudwnv6,2025-05-26 18:40:08

Misty not only eats indiscriminately but she hoards food when she thinks it’s threatened. She doesn’t want to be starving again 
Lottie treats food as “holy” or magical, it has a function, and each function is to treat something which she feels is lacking in her own body.
We don’t inherently see Van interacting with food, however we do see her interact with alcohol, yet again perhaps a form of self harming, especially in the face of her cancer diagnosis. 
Nat, we know eats candy, sugar, chocolate, i think because this is some of the only stuff she can stomach.

The most interesting thing about Adult Misty as a character is her relationship with food.,"This comment got me thinking -- it's actually really interesting that Shauna is often seen in the kitchen in the scenes with her family. Perhaps, because of her role as the butcher, Shauna feels that her usefulness is primarily as a cook/butcher at home as well. This may be augmented because she also lacks the ability, at least early on, to connect emotionally with her daughter and her husband. Hence, her conversation in season 1 with Callie when she asks to have a meaningful conversation and immediately launches into how she is making meatloaf, which Callie sees as rudimentary, but to Shauna this ability is what makes her useful and thus brings meaning to her life. This is especially so because being a stay-at-home mom is not how she pictured her life would play out before the plane crash. She had great aspirations that she was never able to attain because of the crash and her subsequent choices. One of the only ways she can feel a sense of achievement is through this role as the cook for her family. This speaks not just to how she feels can be of use within her family but also touches on how she was able to find meaning and survive in her role as the butcher/cook in wilderness. In that sense, she has not changed. She still strives to be needed. Ergo, her adititude in the wilderness, her skepticism but ultimate loyalty towards the wilderness worship, her anger towards Nat for being named as the leader, her vindictive affair with Adam, and her behavior towards her daughter. Kind of a side tangent, but in that way, I think her need to be needed is actually very similar to Misty and I see the comparisons between them and their (albeit very different) psychopathic tendencies as well.",1h297d0,lziwp1m,2024-11-29 06:31:37

People contain multitudes. It's why something like introversion or extroversion isn't a direct link to how social someone *wishes* to be. Or how someone like Mitch Hedberg might do stand up while not making eye contact. Or how OOP might have truly damaged some relationships in her time, but seems to be on a path of genuine care and repair.

Like what do you mean you have traits I can sympathise with and understand? What? You are not thoroughly evil? Clearly you have just been a Normal Person who has been a victim all this time and those other people are actually the evil disordered people.


There are so many disorders and overlaps and comorbidities and coping mechanisms and nature vs nurture and varying degrees of the disorders that actual evil people deep in the throes of absolute denial and zero self reflection who have their disorders affect every aspect of their life in and around it deeply are rather rare while the disorders themselves are not so much.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"My 2 cents. I believe her when she says shes a narcissist. You see I was born without being able to feel hungry. How can that possibly relate? Because we're both kind of trying to emulate what everyone else does just on hardwired instinct. I never felt hungry until I was 10 or 11. My hunger isn't the same as yours. It's very time based and if I ignore it for 30.minutes or an hour then it goes away. In college o got wrapped up in other things I forgot to eat for 3 days. My freshman 15 was losing 15 pounds lol... Which honestly wasn't healthy either. 


But my point is if you didn't know me you'd probably never know. But if you hung out with me and were really observant, you could pick up those unauthentic vibes. The manufacture signs. The motions I go through because it's what I've learned I should be doing. It just doesn't feel quite right. 


And her whole post just feels that way. Narcissists make everything about them. As she did through this whole post. She also says she feels like she's the best at everything. Yep I picked up on that just reading the post. The best ideas, always right on her feelings and desires. And I'm not saying she's wrong. I'm saying she's working really hard at masking but it's got that tinge of unauthenticness to it. A flavor I'm very familiar with. At the end of the day though, I believe strongly in judging a person based on their actions and not their intentions. So regardless of why she's doing these things, they're good things to do and I'm giving her credit where it is due.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"A realization that I came to within the last year was that NPD is one of the last mental health issues that is freely stigmatized and used to shit on other people. It's the last bastion of unopposed armchair diagnosis. You don't like somebody? They're a narcissist. Someone does something shitty? They're a narcissist. You don't agree with a random person /politician/ celebrity? Narcissist. 

It's incredible to me that people can be so soft and kind about so many mental health diagnoses these days but narcissists? Absolutely not, k!ll 'em with fire, you know? As if it isn't a legitimate mental health diagnosis that impacts people's lives in countless ways. It's like it isn't pretty enough for people to be nice. It isn't popular enough to feel compassion  for those who have it as an actual mental health issue for people to care. It's the medieval leper of mental illnesses. I get it. I've been in a relationship with someone who is diagnosed as a narcissist by multiple mental health care professionals. And he was absolutely the most abusive person I've ever met in my life. Completely different than OOP in his actions and life. He can twist people so, so easily and he absolutely adores any and all eyes on him. And he's in therapy! His therapist is one of the people he manipulates the most easily. He is an incredibly charming monster. OOP isn't. Mental health diagnoses are not a monolith. Maybe if my ex had had the kind of foresight and help that OOP has then he would have turned out more like that.

Reading from the perspective of someone who has a diagnosis of NPD and seeing everything that they've done with their life to live within the bounds of that mental health issue is fascinating. Especially knowing that they are drawn to others with the same diagnosis just like every other mental health issue. We seek out a community of people who understand us. It's basic human nature. They have built an entire life for themselves that facilitates their mental health diagnosis while minimizing the impact that diagnosis has on the entire rest of the world who isn't like them. It's commendable.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"People don't understand that NPD isn't the same in any case, there are different types of narcissists. Most people think of malignant narcissists, when they hear NPD, but that's not the same as a plain old 'normal' attention seeking narcissist. And OOP describes a textbook example of the latter. 

My mum was an attention seeking narc, and she made a complete turnaround after she got her diagnosis. She still craved attention, but she would channel it so it was **your** praise and attention she got and became very loving and shed the habis she'd copied from her malignant narcissistic mother. I never once in my life doubted she loved me, even though she was horrible in my youth. 

Pure malignant narcissists never change. They don't care for others, and gain pleasure from hurting people. But narcissists on the lower scale will do anything for positive interactions and praise after their therapy, and if they find out someone hates them, their levels of submission can turn their disorder back on themselves.",1hzfadq,m6q0knp,2025-01-12 09:46:07

I was on the periphery of a friend group like this for several months. The men all vied for the “alpha” position until the top dog (the richest, most narcissistic) was chosen. He was then careful to regularly spotlight the achievements of the other guys to avoid a mutiny. Most of the group’s activities were centered around his interests, appetites and whims. The women were entirely fabulous all the time, with most conversations revolving around praiseworthy appearances, talents or experiences.

It felt like visiting a bizarre Instagram reality with the Real Housewives. We constantly went to fancy dinners, parties, and important events. It was front row tickets, restaurant openings or theme nights every weekend. When our group was at events, we regularly got applause. Even camping was a fashion show and gear expo, with the men performing impressive feats of strength for crowds. 

But they also did karaoke with a full sound system in a crowded campground until 1am, and thought it was HILARIOUS. At restaurants, they’d assume everyone there wanted to hear their conversations. Other patrons complained and they thought it was funny. Every person in the group was randomly either exactly on time or at least 90 minutes late with zero explanation. They were verbally abusive to their children. I could go on and on. Alcohol gave them an excuse to be audacious/vulgar in public places. But they were beautiful and rich, and there never seemed to be any real consequences. Their behavior was often embarrassing, but I think they were incapable of feeling embarrassed.

On the other hand, I know one self aware narcissist in my social circle and at least he'd acknowledge it when people communicated to him that something he did or said was inappropriate or that it hurt.

If you don't have the same intuitive/emotional understanding of the world as everyone else, then of course you'd think it's normal to be shy and not want attention if that's the kind of media you see.

But I think the biggest problem are the parents. It seems the dad always enabled OOP as a child and the mom is then enabling the sister. They both contributed to the issues the sisters have.

And the sister's therapist also seem to be a problem as OOP says the therapist ""helped with setting those boundaries"" - if that is true, the therapist enabled the sister to be controlling to ounish the OOP.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"Chiming in here. Similar boat as OP but slightly less on the delusional side. Therapist's official take is that there's definitely NPD tendencies/a bit of a superiority complex but due to being very high functioning autistic/adhd he's not sure if it's emotionally driven NPD or if I'm cataloging things that I'm objectively better at, feeding into perfectionism to get even better, and *then* having a superiority complex when I outperform... it's definitely a melting pot of things 

The comparisons part is from the autism, since comparisons create the foundation for good/bad, normal and not. It just... also applies to everything in how I view people (comparisons, sorting into little categories, tagging people mentally with labels, rankings, etc). Without that I'd have no clue how to be normal 

I wonder if OP has a bit of that going on too. But, from what she says, it seems more emotionally driven NPD than anything else xD 

The self-awareness is critical, though. I got lucky in that developing as part of discovering the ""what makes you differnt from others and how to make up for it"" experience growing up. I have friends who only realized way later (again, good people, just a lot like how OP describes) and I still enjoy spending time with them because them wanting the attention/to be the best doesn't really bother me it just kinda reads as cute?

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"I think narcissism can develop from 2 different pathways: trauma, or being raised like OOP with a parent who practically idolizes them and makes them feel like they can do no wrong. I watched an interview with a woman who was a diagnosed narcissist, who was very sick as a small child (cancer I think). Her parents were so relieved that she survived, they treated her as a miracle in everything she did. When she got to college, away from home, and didn't have that constant praise and admiration from her parents, she became severely depressed. Seeking help for her depression was how she ended up being diagnosed with NPD.

I think trauma is the more common cause of narcissism, and develops as a defense mechanism in order to survive. 

My worry for OOP's child is that she will be raised the same way OOP was. OOP talks about how she is the most perfect baby ever and loves her so much. I suspect that love is predicated on her seeing her baby as an extension of herself, the same way she admits her and her husband see each other as extensions of themselves. That is a lot of pressure to put on a child, but it is also likely OOP and her husband will treat that child as if she is the best thing to ever exist and can do no wrong.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"Oh! I actually have experience in this. My grandmother and my uncle are both textbook narcissists. My grandmother and her second husband had a great marriage. He was also a narcissist. They enabled each other. It’s like the OOP said about her husband, they basically view each other as extensions of themselves. They are The Best, so obviously they deserve to be with someone who is also The Best. It’s not competing for the center of attention if you view the other person getting attention as you also having the spotlight through marriage. My grandmother and her husband were both fairly successful creatives, and they genuinely viewed each others accomplishments as their own. 

My uncle, on the other hand, has never had a successful relationship. He’s had a lot of very short flings where she ended it early because he’s insufferable. He’s also had a couple of two-three year relationships where he ended it. In those longer relationships, they were always people pleasers who worshipped him and he got bored and started to look down on her. If he is The Best, he should be with The Best. An insecure people pleaser is not The Best. 

It’s taken my years of therapy and coming to terms with who the people in my family are, but they aren’t inherently evil. They just have broken brains that make them very difficult to be around. I strongly dislike my uncle, but I respect that he has always ended a relationship when he starts to look down on her instead of staying and getting mean (like my grandmother did with her first husband) and I respect now that in his 60s he’s decided to just stay single and do his own thing instead of inflicting himself on more unsuspecting women.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"TBf, from the original comments it really does sound like the sister went faaar into the ""suppress my sister as a person"" camp as a form of reconciliation.

Like, can't wear what she wants, can't talk about herself, has to double check on conversation topics... This definitely sounds like a step too far.

And yeah, she admits that she wears ball gowns to these events, which is over the top, but it still feels really bad saying she has to wear sweatpants and baggy jackets instead.   Without the context of ""she tends to dial it to 1000%"", it sounds like she's being reduced to an invisible person.  And she really was.

The sister was so controlling, the OOP was down on herself for (some!) of what seemed to me like perfectly normal character traits, and the parental divide made me wonder if it was just a case of family drama pathologising a bit of a self-involved confident girl.

Cos THAT is also a thing. Also a lot of what OP talked about resonated with me, so it is hard to demonise that. (I too have catastrophised a perceived snub from a friend into them secretly hating me, failing sometimes does make me just give up in the hump, I have a huge AO3 library where I rewrite minor characters as major ones, and I absolutely love attention!!.)

Then I'd go home and cut my arms up and want to die.

My first therapy session in the BPD program, I did the same thing. My defence mechanism was all the way up. I was halfway through a very rational explenation of what went on when my therapist apologized for interrupting and asked, ""but what where you feeling?"" First I didn't even understand his question, I was explaining to him! ""But what where you feeling?""

Because I had no idea what specific emotions felt like and my whole life I'd been back-analyzing situations to ""fill in"" the appropriate feeling.

The takeaway I from their family dynamic is that the parents indulged and fostered OP's narcissism as she was growing up and neglected the sister and enabled the abuse.


After getting diagnosed and working on improving, OP forced her parents to confront their own role.


This sentence stood out to me
> My mom is very strict though, and says that the boundaries are important and that I abused my sister when we were growing up by stealing attention, so her and her trauma is the most important thing.


The mom isn't taking any responsibility for the sister's shitty childhood and seems to have decided that the only ""fair"" way to handle things is to swap which sibling gets to be the golden child.


The dad seems to realize that abusing OP doesn't actually make up for the sister being abused/neglected as a child.


Again, I'm certainly not an expert, but I would imagine a much healthier boundary would be to let OP talk about her accomplishments, but tell her that she has to drop it and change the subject if she's asked to, rather than just outright forbidding that she can ever say anything about anything she's done.",1hzfadq,m6rvtah,2025-01-12 17:30:40

OOP has gotten some therapy; it sounds like she's made progress. But she's still openly participating in some of those really extreme NPD behaviours. Can she talk about herself in a way that isn't going to be nails-on-a-chalkboard to someone she's hurt that way?

Like, I have a relative who is definitely not NPD, but has that habit of ""topping"" anything you tell him about yourself.

A lot of people end up going no contact with NPD family members because it's impossible to have relationship that isn't harmful. This compromise might seem extreme but it kept OOP from going too far and allowed her sister to feel like she's not going to be blindsided. If sis feels like she can release some control back now, that's also progress.

And yeah the parents should have been better or behaved differently, but it's too late for that now and that's pretty much always the case with personality disorders.

OOP sounds pretty unbearable by her own description and if the sister had to grow up in the same household having every special event overtaken by her sister *and* her father seemingly indulging the sister at every turn (and possibly the mother too, her comments hint at a sudden change from her in their teens when she realised how severely OOP was affecting her sister) it's understandable she might not feel able to have a reasonable and balanced relationship with her now. 


She also needs therapy for her own healing but after so many years of dysfunction they may never have an entirely normal sisterly relationship.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),">

This stood out to me too. OOP says ""I abused my sister"", what about the parents who allowed it to happen?

The sister suffered for what OOP did, but OOP was also a *child* and they had two parents present who just allowed OOP to constantly steal the spotlight. Parents who could and should have at least tried to put a stop to how the sister was being treated, which they seemingly didn't. Because if they had tried to stop it, I would have expected OOPs stories to be along the line of ""I purposefully spilled grape soda on her light pink dress to ruin it so I looked better in comparison"", not ""I got to preform a song during her birthday party and then everyone cheered"". That doesn't happen without support.",1hzfadq,m6uovt6,2025-01-13 01:57:17

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"Sorry, my communication is sometimes a bit unclear. I was referring to the same thing, just trying to add a bit of extra context. I was saying that, because in expert fields it is *still* a contentious issue whether or not incurability means ""not worth the effort"", that ideology has spread through mainstream conversations. The conversations OOP was having in the comments are so similar to the experiences of PD service users in the texts I am reading. 


It is very frustrating to see where it comes from. Especially considering that patients with PDs, like OOP and yourself, have their own goals for what recovery looks like (and often very good ideas!) that are ignored by clinicians as well as family because ""you won't be *cured*"". As if a total absence of symptoms was the only kind of improvement. 


I seriously wish you all the best in working towards your own recovery despite how dismissive people can be. ",1hzfadq,m6pwx44,2025-01-12 09:07:23
AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"It doesn't look like OOP's perspective is screwed now. She doesn't pretend to be better than she is, she doesn't pretend to be a victim, she is answering questions honestly even if they show her to be a total AH. 

OOP was taking sister's spotlight. But she has parents and it is their job to teach her not to take the spotlight. And it sure sounds like she is not her mother's ""golden child"", so what stopped her mother to intervene? And there was an escape, and it was pretty simple one. As soon as OOP was told that she is not the center of the Universe, went to her own therapy, her behavior changed. And it was her parents job to do it earlier, not blaming her at 26 for a song she performed 9 years ago, or for her desire to wear flowers in her hair. 

And OOP's sister doesn't act like someone with no self-esteem. She acts like someone with the same NPD, but without talent to perform. So her own way to be in spotlight is to be a forever victim. She is still traumatized by... OOP's dresses that shoes her body? Does she confront her boss, colleagues, better looking friends and explain them that their looks is triggering her ED, and they all should start wearing oversized sweaters (otherwise they are raging narcissists)? OOP's husband is right, sis and mother humiliate her and bully her for what she did as a child. And it shows them in really bad light.

I know people with PTSD and anxiety, who were treated horribly. I have these issues myself. They don't want to meet with their abuser at restaurants 2/months and vent, they don't tell their abuser what to wear or how to talk. They either go NC, coldly ""tolerate"" the abuser, or are still abused. None of them behaves like OOP's sister, it just doesn't make sense.",1hzfadq,m6qecpj,2025-01-12 12:06:58
AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"Yeah, this makes sense to me as well. Admittedly, this is the OOP's wedding; she and her husband are funding it, and they can do what they wish. 

All of that notwithstanding? I wouldn't let this person anywhere near my life. Certainly not my child, ever. I have some experience with narcissists.

She describes going from happy to no contact, to happy within the span of a fucking car ride. Imagine how that plays out with her children, **or her sister's children.**

None of that even touched on her husband and father either. For the life of me, I don't really know why her sister hasn't just severed all contact.

AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"It's just damn hard to find friends these days. 

I'm a pretty hardcore echoist (like the opposite of a narcissist I love to be a supporting act) and I eventually learned I just need to be upfront about who I am and what I want. My last dating bio specified I was looking for someone to decide what's for dinner. 😂 It worked, I'm married and he does decide. Tell people you love to be the center of attention, you're competitive, and you're not afraid to be the one that orders pizza. Be yourself (but with good manners nobody can be themselves all the way at first) and also tell people who you are. Friend apps are a good tool because you can just put it all out there and the people who want you will swipe. 

As far as echoists like me go, the problem is making a relationship that lasts. I don't speak up about my problems and then I befriend folks who are self-centered and don't think to ask about my problems, in part because they wouldn't stay quiet so they assume I'll speak up too. My problems pile up while I exhaust myself on them (I have no survival instincts) and then it all ends in fire and resentment. So I will say, friends like me require some upkeep too, just a different kind. I'll gas you up and tell you you're the best at everything (and never compete, its not my thing), and you need to ask how I'm doing regularly and try to keep an eye out for me being quietly sad.

CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,"All of your downsides come down to the idea that there is more food on the kids plate than it would be healthy for the kid to eat.  
In order to solve this problem there is your options are throwing away a bunch of food or to let the kid have input on how big of a portion to serve.  
I dont see a reason to choose to throw away food instead of giving the kid some autonomy on what he wants on his plate. 
As for the autonomy option there are a few upsides:  
Its far easier to get a kid to try new things by telling them to finish what is on their plate and putting only a bite sized portion of a new food on their plate.  
The kid learns to take responsibility for their decisions.  
Its easy to treat everyone at the table equal as you would let yourself and your partner decide how much you want to eat anyways.",hxjkfp,fz6qllo,2020-07-25 11:08:52
CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,"I agree that you shouldn't always force children to finish what's on their plate.

But as a parent, you are responsible for their nutrition and their health, and that means that you can't always let them eat or not eat whatever they want to. If you let children eat whatever they want, they'll live on a diet of chicken nuggets, chocolate and ice cream. You have to make a decision to prioritise their wellbeing over their immediate desires and sometimes that means telling them to eat their food or making them eat meals that they might not like.

People need to be conscious of food waste for two reasons. The first is that food waste has a real environmental impact. The second is that food bank usage has skyrocketed (even among the employed) this past decade, and gone from a crisis service to a normal part of people's lives (and this was happening even before COVID hit). A child might not understand the reality that their parents might not be certain when or where their next meal will be and a lot are living with food insecurity. One of the benefits of school meals is you have an opportunity to ensure that every child has at least one nutritious meal per day, so while I don't think schools should go all Mrs Trunchbull they should be especially conscious of low income students who skip meals or waste a lot of food regularly. Maybe forcing children to eat everything is bad, but making them conscious of food waste is not, and being conscious of children who waste food or skip meals is something schools and parents should definitely do as they are signs of abuse, eatiung disorders, etc. There is a real difference between fussiness (which I think it's fair for parents to say 'just eat your food' as long as they've made an effort to make something the child should be able to eat), food aversions, and skipping meals because of abuse or disorders, and they all require different approaches.",hxjkfp,fz6kds7,2020-07-25 09:21:13
CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,"Disagree completely. First of all, children, let's say at the ages of 3 to 5 specifically, don't have a mature relationship with ""hunger"".  They will eat when they aren't hungry and they will not eat, when they *are* hungry. Do you know why? Because they want sweets. 

This craving is completely natural, in fact at that age they don't even have a ""too sweet, too much sugar"" off switch.  

As a parent, your duty is to prepare your children for the world. Part of this includes feeding them a healthy diet which includes vegetables and other whole non-processed foods that aren't loaded with sugar. 

When they don't want to eat these foods, despite being hungry, this is where the parent has to explain that they have to eat these foods. Eventually, the children will become familiar with whole foods and vegetables that may be bitter.

CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,"Thanks, here's one about sugar and salt:

>Sweetness reflects the presence of caloric sugars in plants.  Infants and children have higher preferences than adults and these preferences can be modified by experience [for review, see [11]. That many of the bitter foods that people like most (e.g. coffee, tea, beer) have pharmacological properties helps explain their desirability and the fact that people need to learn to like them. Nevertheless, with experience even bitter vegetables can come to be liked [13,14].

>A sensitivity to and preference for salty tasting substances (almost the only one being NaCl) also appears to have an innate component that develops at around 4 months of age. By 2 years of age, children's preferences for salty foods are even greater than they are for adults [1,15]. Along with proposed innate factors, prenatal developmental events modify the infant's and child's preferences for salty tastes. Severe maternal emesis can have an enduring influence on response of offspring to salty taste [16,17,18]. Similarly, we have shown [19] that several behavioral measures related to salty taste preference are inversely related to birth weight over the first 4 years of life. Recent unpublished studies from our laboratories suggest that early experiences may profoundly modify the degree of salt liking in children. If verified, these observations are significant since it is generally accepted that excess salt intake can lead to or exacerbate hypertension. - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202923/",hxjkfp,fz6nd7q,2020-07-25 10:13:34
CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,"If you ever have kids you will realize real quick how hard it is to get a kid under the age of 10 to actually sit and eat a meal.

The goal is to teach the kids that they need to take an appropriate amount of food when they dish up and that they need to eat a complete meal. That's the goal and the intention. My nephew (7 y/o got excited because we were having ribs for dinner. He took 8 ribs and took one bite from 3 different ones.

This is a condition that has interested me even before my journey to become a physician because I had colleagues and friends who were victims and I was powerless to support them. Eating disorders also overlap greatly with many social determinants of health, such as income, social inclusion, mental health, substance use, and is impacted by many elements within society that makes it interesting to study. The consequences are also profound and leaves a devastating trail of broken families in its wake. I hope that people get the opportunity to educate themselves more about this condition so that they recognize the signs either within themselves or others. It's important to bring up these sensitive issues in a discreet and tactful way. You may be able to save a life armed with important knowledge and awareness of eating disorders and I hope that this story, and my post, is educational for you.

I am Canadian but the US data and resources are just as useful.

Eating disorders (EDs) are behavioral conditions characterized by severe and persistent disturbance in eating behaviors, affecting physical, psychological, and social functions. The lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder in America is 0.6%, 0.3% and 1.2% respectively. It should be noted that this is likely an underestimation, especially given the significant stigma associated with mental illness, combined with the additional stigma of eating disorders. Females are typically many times more likely to develop eating disorders than males. It's also important to consider that many eating disorders were not even considered diagnoses until after 1979, and measurements for these figures may be variable.

The stigma around eating disorders are profound and the evidence is strong for all forms of eating disorder. People have a perception that victims of eating disorders are personally responsible for causing their disorder. People think that victims often lack self discipline (""just eat more""). Some people believe victims of eating disorders are attention seeking, either wanting attention to their ""beauty"" or ""trauma.""

Unfortunately in society, obese and overweight people tend to be perceived as less valuable to society. This is seen even in children, who are more likely to prefer photos of normal weight appearing children compared to overweight children. Eating disorders are most common among female adolescents and are often considered the most impressionable, combined with being the most vulnerable. Interestingly, eating disorders are also described as a disease of the affluent, where those in higher socioeconomic status being more likely to develop anorexia and bulimia. This may be due to the importance placed on public perceptions. It's also important to consider the impact of the ""ideal body"" on development of eating disorders. In particular, the ideal female figure has significantly changed in the 20th century, with marked decreases in size. The female internalization of the ""ideal thin beauty"" increases risk for eating disorders significantly.

Other risk factors include adversity during childhood, being transgender, concurrent mental health diagnosis, I have heard of people mentioning that being underweight is a risk factor for anorexia... but it is unclear if that is a cause or effect... for example, people with anorexia are inherently underweight as a part of the diagnosis.

The medical complications of eating disorders is miles long affecting tons of organ systems.

Management is incredibly complex, but it really requires support both from family and professionals. Some may need hospital admission in order to stabilize their condition medically. The mainstay treatment involves psychotherapy (CBT, motivational interviewing, family therapy, etc) and nutritional rehabilitation. It's important to consider refeeding syndrome among those that eat too quickly. Pharmacotherapy is NOT the mainstay treatment, but it is often aimed at weight gain as well as addressing ancillary mood concerns (such as depression or anxiety). Antipsychotics like olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole have been documented, but there is a paucity of randomized control trials and the evidence for their use is questionable. Only olanzapine has been seem to have some potential benefits.

Lastly, remember the SCOFF acronym ... as this is commonly used in primary care as a basic screen for people with increased risk for eating disorders. Ask yourself these questions and answer them honestly.

Do you make yourself Sick because you feel uncomfortably full?

Do you worry you have lost Control over how much you eat?

Have you recently lost more than One stone (14 pounds or 6.35 kg) in a three-month period?

Do you believe yourself to be Fat when others say you are too thin?

Would you say that Food dominates your life?

A final note... eating disorders are very serious, but there are ways to manage and live with the condition. Don't give up hope. Love yourself and each other. Let's focus on reducing the stigma and support uplifting our bodies.

If you have other questions in the future, I'd be happy to help within reason (if I'm not busy seeing patients) or visit us on the /r/askdocs subreddit.

Take care,

I had really hoped that maybe their dad could do something, but he's causing just as much harm as their mom. How you feel about your body, those comments like the mom makes, really can affect your children's relationship with food and their body image too.

It’s hard to explain. It feels like OOP is heading down a similar route - she’s so terrified of developing anorexia that she’s spiralling. Poor sweet thing, I hope one of those parents can get their shit together and get that kid in therapy",1gx0w53,lydmcvn,2024-11-22 06:34:51
I caught my twin doing something but she says it’s no big deal ,">OOP: I would totally take it. I don’t think anyone has hugged me since she got admitted. It’s like I’m invisible now

This is quite literally one of the saddest, most heart wrenching things I’ve ever heard someone say in my 40 years on this earth.  

OOP said her parents are really young. And I know that they say when someone has a child as a teen, they kind of freeze mentally at that age. But holy shit. Her mom is 33 years old and her dad is 34. GET YOUR FUCKING SHIT TOGETHER.  

Both of her parents are making this about themselves. They’re more worried about how it looks, how they feel, and how this will affect them/their lives, than either of their children. Which actually isn’t difficult to do when they quite literally are willingly incapable of, +/- have an anaphylactic allergy to, giving a shit about anyone other than their own selfish asses. 

OOP is more mature than the two of them combined. She has shown more emotional intelligence, and general intelligence than a lot of grown ass adults I know. She is quite literally, single handedly treading water to keep her and her sister afloat. She has done all of this with grace, kindness, courage, bravery, and sensitivity that are beyond amazing.  

**OOP, if you stumble upon this, and read through the comments - I just wanted to let you know:**  You are an amazing young woman. I have two little girls. If they grow up to be half of the wonderful human you are, I would be elated.  You are doing, and have done, everything right.  But please, do not allow yourself to get lost in the shuffle. Obviously your sister is a priority - but that doesn’t mean your needs are any less important.  Your feelings, wants, needs, and concerns ARE important and deserve to be heard. 

And. Remember, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. If you’re being ignored, be squeaky. Like *REAL SQUEAKY* until your cry for help is heard and something is done about it.  If you’re told you’re just making this all about you, don’t listen to them. Tell them, “Yeah.  Well.  This IS about me right now. And I need help. So what’s your point?”  Never be afraid to advocate for yourself.

As I said, I am a mom to two little girls. I know very little about what your sister is going through. But. If you need a “mom-for-a-minute”, someone to vent to, ask random questions, or just need some support/encouraging words, message me anytime.  I’m no therapist, but I am good at listening. I’m not just offering to be nice. I mean it. I’m here if you need someone to talk to.  

I will be praying for your sister and sending all the mom hugs and positive vibes I can muster, your way.  *Mom Hugs* 💜",1gx0w53,lydwijn,2024-11-22 08:17:53

I had a student who was anorexic. She was almost skeletal and actually started to get some hair growth on her face, and her complexion was a mess. She had to be hospitalized, and STILL her father (the mom had died) insisted that she wasn't anorexic and ranted at the doctors for ""lying.""",1gx0w53,lydoto3,2024-11-22 06:58:27

I caught my twin doing something but she says it’s no big deal ,"As a geneticist I really want to comment on this. 

Having a genetic component is not deterministic when it comes to mental health disorders - with a few exceptions like that family with familial schizophrenia due to a weird genetic rearrangement. It makes you more likely to develop a condition but there needs to be a triggering event or events and build up of stress to where you’re not coping anymore and the negative behaviours set in. 

Just because you have a relative with a mental health condition doesn’t mean you’ll develop it too. Anorexia is one of the ones with higher chance of being inherited in identical twins but it’s still not a guarantee you’ll develop it. That said OOPs eating behaviours are concerning and she needs to talk to a therapist about it and the stress she’s undergoing. 

Her mom needs to stop with the comments. She’s making it worse. Redmond’s me of my mom tbh. 

Unfortunately this will be a lifelong battle. I was bulimic in high school and still stuff from body dysmorphia and purging on occasion. Not enough to meet the clinical diagnosis anymore  but any amount of purposely throwing up is not normal.",1gx0w53,lye0sc7,2024-11-22 09:04:38

Neglect/ abuse from emotionally immature parents causes this kind of situations. 

OOP is being the parent that these kids never had and desperately shouldn’t need to be. Wish I could give her a hug and get her sister into an inpatient rehab where OOP can visit anytime.

I would report this in a heartbeat to get those kids support. It’s possible that dad has gone low-contact bc mom is impossible. I’m hoping that at least the dad has realized and jumped in.

My students who go through things like this end up living in in-patient facilities for quite some time. They often need multiple visits until they get their recovery honed just right. 

Both twins deserve loving/ attentive parent(s), mental health care, an adult helping them process this very big and scary experience, and any medical care needed.

I caught my twin doing something but she says it’s no big deal ,"Can I ask your opinion as someone who's parant did this to you?

I have a friend that has both anoxia and that thing where a person exorcise way to much. 

When she eats it's alway ""zero calories""(like cucumber, leafy greens and that sort of things), or those ""light"" product's that taste like garbage.

I'm a certified nurse but I've chosen to stay completely in the ""friend"" lane, both because she's being followed by a whole host of medical professionals that's leagues above me, and because I know me telling her to eat something will not change a damn thing.

The thing is she has a daughter and even if my friend is well aware the she herself is sick, she unfortunately can't see that she's making her daughter sick. 

The kid has always been slender but some kid are simply built that way. My own daughter is rail thin despite eating like a grown man, and when she's at Grandma's place, she will eat enough sugar-crap to make me feel second hand nauseous. So my friends kid being slender isn't alarming by itself.

But...

Some time ago I started making and eating dinner a couple of times a week together with my friends daughter(do to some unrelated stuff making my friend unable to do it herself), and it's horrible to see just how much my friend has obscured the kids relationship with food. 

I eat pretty healthy, with lots of vegetables, trying to avoid saturated fat and simple carbohydrates, making my meals from scratch, and I try to make it both taste and look good. But I'm neither a health nut nor a saint so there's the occasional use of butter, honey, full fat cream etc. 

But my friend's kid act like I'm trying to forcefeed her pure fat covered in corn syrup. I'm sitting there listening to an 11yo kid ""lecturing"" me, telling me all these obscure and simply bonkers things, about how to eat healthy, what a healthy woman should look like, that fat people are gross, that they need to learn to control themselves and that they are some kid of subhumans. According to her Taylor Swift is fat btw. 

I have of cause reacted because of this, both by gently trying to speak with the kid about what healthy eating habits and food actually is, and by showing her what a, according to science, healthy woman actually looks like. And I've had several, not so gentle, conversations with my friend about it, but I'm also well aware that this is way above my pay grade, I alone don't stand a snowballs chance in Hell solving this mess. 

But I'm not really sure where to go from here. Yes I could call my countries equivalent to CPS, and while they are most not terrible they do have to act according to the law, and unfortunately those laws are mostly crap, since they in short says ""the parantes should alway get a second chance"" in stad of ""the child should alway be in focus and be prioritized"". 

Calling them will also most likely make my friend cut contact, and while I gladly end any friendship if it means that a child won't suffer a life in Hell, I'm not that keen on loosing contact with the kid, because if I'm out and CPS fails, that kid will be left with noone that neith can or will help her. 

The kids father isn't an option being a hardcore 1% Biker that I have no qualms admitting scares the shit out of me.

My friend is estranged from her family do to them being absolutely awful people. 

So I really don't know what to do, and I don't expect a stranger on Reddit to fix it for me, but I would be super grateful for any inputs or thought's you might have, as someone that has experienced something similar to what my friend daughter are caught in.",1gx0w53,lye464g,2024-11-22 09:42:00

"Anyone else working on having a healthier relationship with food, not just a “better” diet?","I have been degrees of 'fit' most of my life. In HS and college it was sports and the desire to perform well in them, and after that it was weightlifting/bodybuilding because it gave me something physical to do with my time since I had no more organized sports, and frankly to better attract females. I know that sounds shitty, but it's honest, especially for a dude in his early 20's at the time. 

Where food fits in on this spectrum is as horsepower basically. I know damn well by now what needs to get done in the kitchen if I want to get done what is needed at the squat cage. Most people attach all these hedonistic types of traits towards food, and that is just a toxic perspective, and furthermore one of the reasons nearly 2/3's of the US is either overweight or obese. That said, what I find to be one of the comforting joys about fitness is I have total 100% control over outcomes. Food, workouts, etc. I hold all the cards. Nobody else. Just me. There are not many areas of life that offer this type of autonomy. I call the shots. I get to say how things go down. Fitness is honestly the great equalizer. Your money or connections can't save you. The fire has gotta come from within or it does not come at all. 

I honestly think it all comes down to finding something physical that you sincerely enjoy doing. You get really into an activity and the natural tendency is to want to excel at it.  This motivates change in other aspects of life, especially food. I am not talking about 60 min on a hamster wheel at Planet Fitness either. Nobody actually enjoys that shit. Or at least most don't. Running, martial arts, parkour, gymnastics, yoga, weights, whatever. It can be anything, but I am of the opinion there is an athlete in all of us, they just might not have discovered their sport or activity yet. While I realize exercise in the grand scope of weight loss is a relatively minor variable, the impacts on the rest of your life are robust. 

So you want a better relationship with food? Find something physical to do and become a badass at it. As you improve you will start to naturally gravitate towards choices more conducive to performance of this activity. It may take time to find something that really turns your gears, but when you do it will be life changing.",1l4yiuk,mwdftrr,2025-06-06 19:48:50

My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"Don’t listen to the comments telling her go eat once a day and walk constantly. Get her to a dietician who can help meal plan appropriately. 

Edit: Someone with an eating disorder can’t be helped, until the mental health aspect is taken care of first. Bombarding someone with an eating disorder with “just go for walks and don’t eat that” is extremely harmful and not helpful right out the gate. Remember mental health first and then work on the weight loss later. 

Edit: Thanks for the awards 🥺",lat8i8,glpy7vz,2021-02-02 11:56:02
My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"Therapy, a dietician. If she doesn't want it you can't make her want it. If she's developed one eating disorder to deal with her emotions (food-reward) it's incredibly easy to let it go the other way and develop anorexia/bulemia/ unhealthy weight loss (food restrict/punishment) 

However I think you should stick to your guns and refuse to enable her binges. You have every right to tell her how you feel about it in the most caring way possible, but as a girl who has lost a good amount of weight I don't think you can motivate her to do something she isn't ready to do.

I think if she was super into fitness and clean eating before,maybe you could help her back on the wagon but if she didn't have those skills in the first place it isn't a thing that will happen magically now.",lat8i8,glpxyuo,2021-02-02 11:52:51

You have to realise that she is most likely self-medicating with food. You can’t make her stop taking her medicine as long as she feels unwell. She has to be well enough to start breaking down her relationship with food. For that, I believe she needs to engage in activities that she loves or has always wanted to, and do it without pressure of accomplishment but also do it in a way that improves her skill in it. She needs transformative activities with a lot of detailed work. Because she needs to get away from her own ruminations.",lat8i8,glpzxd7,2021-02-02 12:17:06

My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"OP, you are taking on too much of this that's about her. You need to separate out the impacts on you from the impacts on her, and stop trying to take responsibility for the impacts on her. Focus on yourself here.

1) it is not acceptable that she pressures you to eat things you don't want to eat. You should lovingly sit down with her and explain that that behavior is not ok, and you're not going to tolerate it any longer. No one should be pressuring you what to do with your own body. Ask her how she would feel if you were pressuring her to smoke pot with you or drink more beer or something like that.

And you just need to be prepared for what to do as it escalates the next time she wants you to eat something. Eg, you say, no, I asked you not to pressure me about this. Then, No -- when it comes to my body, no means no. No, if you say it again I'm leaving the house and going for a walk. NO, STOP VIOLATING MY BOUNDARIES. I'M LEAVING (and then leave).

Don't refuse to take her to McDonalds with any kind of rationale about her health. Just make it about you. I don't want to go. I won't enjoy this trip, you do it on your own. I'm in the middle of something. Etc. Maybe you'll need a sit down conversation where you use an analogy here as well, such as ""imagine you're in the middle of watching a show and I am suddenly like, let's go for a run! I need you to go for a run with me! I'm feeling stressed and I need you to come running with me right now at 10pm or I won't feel better!"" Sounds absurd, right? Well she's doing the equivalent to you.

Finally, stop trying to give her unsolicited advice about weight watchers or whatever. Or for that matter even solicited advice. Let her handle that part of her life on her own.",lat8i8,glq55of,2021-02-02 13:13:26
My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"As a girl who was EXACTLY the same as this until this last year I have to give you the harsh truth - nothing you say or do is going to change her habits. She has to want to do it herself independently. It took me a very long time to get here, but now I do an hour of exercise daily and eat healthily 90% of the time. It has drastically improved my life but it is a struggle to maintain it, emotional binge eating was my problem for about 18 years. Nothing anybody said or did was going to change that until I got to a point where I was truly miserable with myself and decided to make a change.

What you have to realise is, you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to help themselves. This behaviour is as self destructive as any addiction, it just isn’t recognised as such because it’s not seen to be as bad as say, gambling, drugs or alcohol. But it is the same compulsive mentality, and it will take a complete overhaul of personality to correct it. 

I know there is a terrible stigma about leaving someone because they got ‘fat’, but the reality is this is a huge difference in core values and the weight gain is just a symptom. You want to maintain a certain lifestyle and she doesn’t, but expects you to change to suit her, while not being willing to change to suit you. 

I can’t really give you advice on what to do but maybe try this mental exercise;

Replace her behaviour with food to another addiction, say alcohol, so weight gain wasn’t really a factor. But she gets so desperate for a drink she starts fights, encourages you to binge drink constantly, and it was obvious she was an alcoholic, how would you react?",lat8i8,glqbkbp,2021-02-02 14:09:08

Is doesn't just give you weight loss tricks or expect you to give up all the foods you love, but teaches you how to make better choices for a lifetime. 

That being said, I would look into getting her into therapy. There is some reason she turns to food for emotional support and i dont think she will be able to break this habit on her own. She might not even know why herself. 

You might want to go together to some of the sessions to see how you can best support her, but I think you should stick to the idea that if you dont want something to eat you should not eat it.",lat8i8,glpvffk,2021-02-02 11:18:50
My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"Hey there! Masters in Public Health with a concentration in Physical Activity and Behavior here. The original response is so on point. I’m engaged to someone who has a difficult relationship with food. Sometimes hearing helpful information from your SO can feel like an attack. Instead of focusing the conversation on her. Share with her how you think you need to make a change for your career and it sounds like your mental well being. Ask her if she can be your partner in this change and see how she responds. Focus everything on I need your support, will you help me. 

Also, pursuing the mental health aspect of the “responsive eating” would be best but that often comes with time. Suggesting someone see a specialist can be a very slippery slope. 

Definitely don’t suggest she just under eat and walk more. We have information thrown at us about what we “should” do for our health but having information and applying it to your singular experience are two different things. So any studies have shown that when a couple decide to make changes together, they see better results. 
Good luck, stay strong and protect your well-being!

I've known more than anyone's fair share of sketchy men, as most other women have, but from someone I was at least in the same social group as, who'd shown no red flags, this would be so sweet to me.

Please do it again, but maybe give it to me more discretely so that people don’t start asking questions about my situation.”

There is no culture on Earth with the possible exception of Denmark where giving food to people you like is unwelcome.  Oh, there are complexities around it, with food restrictions and differences.  Heck, deliberately serving meat to vegetarians as a hostile act because vegetarianism is weird dates back at least as far as the spread of Buddhism into China.  Same with deliberately serving pork to Jews or Muslims or beef to Hindus – they all date back to the point where those cultures encountered other cultures then people got mad at each other.

But that is all in the context that sharing food with your community is normal in social animals and that sharing food with another member of your species is a way of expressing that you consider them part of your community.

Gifting food is such a huge part of my culture, and a lot of other cultures. 

My friend lost both her parents to Covid - I made her food and took it to her. My uncle lost his wife of fifty years and he was given so much food he didn’t have to even think about cooking for days. He didn’t have much appetite, but the food was there so he could have some when he wanted. 

Another friend is pregnant and nearly due. Her family are sending her food.

A Finnish friend of mine was bemused but happy when her Syrian neighbours came round to gift her food during Ramadan and I explained to her it’s a normal thing to do for your neighbours during that time of year. She went off to make cookies in return and ended up being good friends with them. 

If someone comes to your house you feed them. If they stay for dinner you give them dinner. 

The weirdest cultural dissonance I ever experienced was when a Scandinavian admitted that yeah, it’s normal not to feed guests if they come over. There was some argument about that even among the Scandinavians, but it was normal for some of them. 

Different cultures treat food differently, but it’s very often associated with love and care and just…positive things. I really struggle with people attacking someone for sharing what’s essentially a fundamental and precious resource.",1h3vp26,lzys1sn,2024-12-02 01:19:24

When you go into gift giving, it crosses into a level of intimacy that most of the time hasn’t been earned yet. Making food multiple times for someone is not a small innocent act of kindness, it is a deliberate show of affection. Well-meaning, yes, but premature at the least.  
Ultimately, women who experience that kind of thing are often put on guard because of how often male “kindness” is simply performative. Not always, but plenty often enough.

Just finished reading and I feel like this is going to affect my relationship with food,"This made me really happy to read. I'm excited for you! I think Senshi would be really proud of you for trying new foods, especially when it's so difficult for you. 

It has impacted my relationship with food, too... I hate cooking, my ADHD makes it an exhausting chore for me, and I have issues with low appetite so I often don't even feel hungry or desire to eat. So cooking always feels like a monumental amount of effort for the sake of eating, which I often don't even really want to do.

The messages from DunMeshi have helped me view food as important, and try harder to find ways to make eating enjoyable and tasty for me. It helps me prioritize eating and nutrition, and to be more willing to put more effort into cooking in order to make something that tastes good.

At the same time, it does make me feel frustrated and... Sad? Because I've been trying to find ways to find joy in cooking the way Senshi does and I haven't been succeeding. I still hate cooking. But it will probably take a lot more time and effort for me to be able to see something positive in something I hate, so I might just need to put more work and patience into it. 

Even though I hate making my own food, when I have an appetite I do love eating at restaurants, eating food other people cook, and trying new foods. I think there is a lot of joy in food and trying new things, so I hope you can experience that. I don't know what it's like to have arfid; maybe the goal is something else, like expanding your safe food options or improving your ability to tolerate different foods or being able to add more nutrition to your safe foods or something.

But having an inner Senshi to encourage me helps; it's also easier to remember to complement things when you have a stray thought that goes ""where's the vegetables? You need vitamins"" and easier to get food when you think ""you deserve the effort it takes to have a tasty meal that won't make you feel sick.""

Like yeah that’s a lot of calories for one pastry, I get why someone would choose to not eat it, but I also don’t need to hear about it every 2 seconds. Not everyone feels the need to check the calories on our food menu before ordering a snack! 

It’s also very silly to be shocked that a sugary pastry from a fast food place (let’s be honest Starbucks is fast food at this point) has a lot of sugar and calories! Like how are you surprised about that? That’s frankly why people order it; because people want something that has no purpose other than tasting good! 

When fellow partners are making a drink that has a lot of syrups and start voicing their disgust, I feel the same way because of course I’ll be THINKING it’s kinda gross while making it but I’d never voice it out loud and make someone feel bad for their drink order. We’re paid to make the drinks people are paying for, not to question them or judge. Like you mentioned, maybe someone is diabetic and needs to get their blood sugar to a certain level.

I understand wanting to be mindful about what you put into your body but counting calories down to the last sip is how you get an ED. I’ve started to repair my relationship with food and like Starbucks is not something you should be getting everyday unless it’s like ykno a plain latte or black coffee. Syrup filled drinks are treats, it’s ok to have drinks. My mom tried to push weight watchers on me with their point system like, I do not want to view food as points, just like calories that is how you get a bad relationship with food. Have a treat every once in awhile! It’s ok to have your Frappuccino, just don’t drink it 7 days a week. 

I feel like I get like mass downvoted in the general for Starbucks subreddit for saying it but bruh stop with the how many calories does my heavily modified drink have. The usual SKINNY vanilla latte and their REDUCED FAT turkey bacon like😭😭😭

It can feel so amazing to start the day with some great food!

I like to cook and I like bigger breakfast. I find savory breakfasts more appealing and I find typical breakfast (cereal, frui, yoghurt, etc) unsatisfying so I stay away from them (it can be fun figuring out what feels really great when you tap into your intuitive cues!)

Some of my favourite breakfast are:

- Scrambled tofu, peppers, onion, wrap, Tabasco.
- Two vegan sausages on a bagel with tomato chutney.
- Two slices of sourdough toast, half an avocado, chilli flakes.
- cubed potatoes, artichokes, peppers, tomatoes, cheese.
- cheese and tomato toastie and a Banana
- peanut butter and banana on two pieces of toast.
- vegan sausage patty, hash brown, cheese, English muffin.

I was pregnant when she got married and in her wedding party. She told us to come hungry because there would be SOOO much food. Being in the wedding and so busy that day I was starving by the time we ate. It was a plated meal so you got your plate of food vs family style or buffet. Oh my God!

"“Fast metabolism” is a lie, stop making yourself feel bad.","I agree wholeheartedly with your post, OP. I'd just add that I think most ""naturally skinny"" people don't use food as comfort, compared to the way most of us who've struggled with our weight probably do. Of course, you can overeat calories gradually over time and gain weight that way. But many of us have had disregulated appetites and have also used food in an unhealthy way, whether that's comfort eating, food addiction, binge eating, yoyo dieting, etc. for years, causing rapid weight gain and disregulated metabolism. 

""Naturally skinny"" people eat what they want, then move on. Having a large meal just means the next meal, or 2 will be smaller. There's no emotional attachment to comfort food, no guilt for having a blowout, and no spiralling or binging. We see them eating a large meal, precisely because they're not secretly eating thousands of calories when no one is watching. They never worry about being judged for what they're eating because there's no stigma attached to a slim person eating high calorie foods. If anything, they're probably encouraged to and praised for eating like this. 

I do envy people who have no emotional connection to food! It must be much easier for them to eat the right amount for the bodies effortlessly.",1lr1dw5,n17dmxz,2025-07-03 22:02:18

But other days she'll say that she's very conscious of her calories and incredibly careful about what she eats.

"“Fast metabolism” is a lie, stop making yourself feel bad.","This is absolutely the answer to a lot of things that differ between people who struggle with food/weight and those who don’t. 

When we rely on subjective info, like how much food is “a lot,” we aren’t taking into account how much variance exists. 

Two slices of pizza and a couple wings is not much to some people but “stuffing my face” to others. Some people eat a Chipotle bowl and still feel hungry whereas others boast about a Chipotle bowl being two full meals. 

This is true of exercise/sedentary behaviors, too. People living in cities that walk/bike a ton would say on a lazy day that they were sedentary, when in fact they still walked 5000 steps. Meanwhile people in car-centric suburbs that walk minimally would say they had a super active day if they got in 5000 steps. 

Or ask a gym rat what it means to have a light day, and I bet their answer would be exactly what somebody who never goes to the gym says is how much they’d do in a single normal or intensive day at the gym.

As someone who has struggled with EDs for most of my life, having my daughter was the turning point for me in my attitude. Not saying I got better overnight, I still struggle, but I would do anything to keep my kids from dealing with the same issues I have

My ED was inherited through multiple generations, and now I’m doing the work to break the cycle. Its bad enough when kids pick up things that parents try to hide, but for your wife to blatantly not give a shit and make you feel bad for your completely correct take is wild

Your wife doesn’t get a pass to traumatise your kids just because she isn’t putting in the work to recover",18fcyk4,kctgxy2,2023-12-10 21:34:43
AITAH for telling my wife to stop making her eating disorder obvious to the kids?,"My kid (15m)  just came out of an ED treatment program. He asked me to see a dietician who specializes in ED as part of my supporting him. I have thought, his whole life, that was modeling a positive relationship to food and I have been devastated to learn that I’ve been unconsciously doing the opposite. 

Everything I do related to food is a direct reaction to growing up with a mom with a lifelong undiagnosed eating disorder. She put so much shit in my head that I am only now coming to terms with. I am so glad to be doing the work, but I have made my dietician almost cry at stories of what my mom did and said to me and to herself. And I am so humbled to learn how much of what I do in response to my mom has affected what he does in response to me. (I wanted to do the opposite from my bitchy mom. He and I are close, so he just learned to do what I did, which was overindulge as a “F-you” to my mom.) 

Show this to your wife. She HAS TO GET BETTER. She has to BE better. When she resists, it’s the disorder defending itself, and she has to stop letting it control her thoughts and actions. 

You are not being alarmist. This is affecting the kids. There were several women in my son’s program who were moms. There is nothing wrong with getting help. She can do an outpatient program. 

Please please please, OP’s wife, if you read this I KNOW, and I get it, and your ED is lying to you. Tell it to fuck off already, all it wants is to take you away from everything you love.",18fcyk4,kctj6ha,2023-12-10 21:48:28

AITAH for telling my wife to stop making her eating disorder obvious to the kids?,"NTA.

There was a trend earlier this year from daughters of almond, special K, low fat yogurt moms and how it impacted their mental health and self esteem.

Your wife is 100% TA for making comments about “bad foods” in front of the children. Even if she chooses not to deal with her eating disorder, it’s not okay to expose others to it. 

Your wife needs to go back to therapy, and you should be looking into child therapists for your girls to get ahead of it. **Seriously, do everything you can to get ahead of this illness with the girls even if your wife won’t cooperate.**

OP - this is a hill to die on. 

Your wife apparently does not care enough about the effect she's having on your children to make any changes. Therefore, you need to make the changes, and they probably have to be drastic. 

First, I strongly urge you to get a few sessions with a psychologist who specializes in eating disorders. Talk about how to inoculate your children. Also talk about taking your children away from your wife unless she gets help. 

Seriously - I very rarely recommend leaving, and wouldn't recommend it here, except you have children to consider. You need to get them out of that environment. 

My mother had a mild eating disorder, and she passed it on to me. By the time I was 50, despite having gotten help by that point, I had done so much damage to my body, I could barely walk. The damage I have done is irreversible, and I doubt I'll live to 65. It was a strong contributing factor in my infertility.

I've been in and out of ED treatment (after getting my ED from my mom), and while I don't have kids, I've met women there who do. I have never once heard any of them have this attitude.

""I set up a meeting and made amends with my daughter about how I influenced her feelings around food growing up.""  ""I always avoided doing my behaviors in front of my family at the dinner table."" ""I didn't want to model unhealthy behaviors for my kids."" And, most of all, ""My child(ren) are what keep me going / what I remind myself I have to live for / why I'm pursuing treatment / why I want to recover..."" ""They're my 'why'"".

Look, mental illnesses are serious and no one is at fault for having them. However, you are 100% at fault when you are aware that you have one, but you refuse to do anything about it. Especially when it is affecting others. 

What makes this worse is, as true as that statement is for anyone who has one, it’s even more serious for parents.  Mental illness is not a free pass to be a neglectful, ignorant, or selfish parent.  ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS CAUSING HARM TO THEIR CHILD. 

OP’s wife refused help for herself even though it has been obvious (to herself *and* OP) that it’s negatively affecting her life.  Ok, I don’t agree with that, but what is OP to do? He can’t make her get help. 

But now it’s a totally different ball game. It’s not just a “her issue” anymore.  Her wanting to handle it on her own when it’s really only impacting her is one thing.  But now, her ED is negatively affecting her daughter. This is the point where she loses the right to want to deal with it privately.  

She *KNOWS* that it’s affecting her daughter. She is choosing to ignore how serious this is (even though deep down, she knows). She also basically said she doesn’t care about what this is doing to her daughter, and she only cares about how all of this affects her. 

This is selfish and at this point, this is also neglect.  OP’s wife is neglecting her child in favor of herself. OP needs to call it what it is. His wife is currently dealing with a completely unmanaged mental illness, she is neglecting her children, and she is knowingly/willingly negatively affecting her daughters’ health.  

OP needs to put his foot down. She might be unable to intervene or put a stop to this, but he’s not. Either she seeks help for her ED, or she gets to be around her kids. They can no longer coexist.  

And I know OP only spoke about his 10 year old but, the damage has also already been done to the 8 year old as well.  Even if she doesn’t pick up on her mom’s influences, she’s going to start mimicking her older sister. (Source: have two girls, a couple years apart) Even if he does step in, this is going to get worse before it gets better.  If he doesn’t do something about this, he’s potentially signing his daughters up for a life long battle with body image and food.",18fcyk4,kcvacnt,2023-12-11 05:31:51

AITAH for telling my wife to stop making her eating disorder obvious to the kids?,"Not OP but I grew up with a health obsessed mom. Our Koolaid was made with Equal, not sugar. 


We never ate out. Ever. Pizza delivery maybe once a year was a treat. We made our own pizza at home. 


Even on road trips, she’d pack a cooler with tuna sandwiches and celery and carrot sticks. We’d stop at rest areas and picnic. No fast food.


I remember spending the night with a friend in middle school. Their parents were going to pick up dinner at Taco Bell and asked what I wanted. I had no idea. I think I asked for 2 tacos to be polite. They were awesome! I had no idea. 


My sibling and I are now in our 40’s and are both obese. We go up and down with weight over the years but once we were out of the house and could choose what we wanted, we went nuts and it hasn’t stopped.

I (18 F) have apparently been dating my best friend (19 M) for an entire year but didn’t know until today. Need help asking him about it.,"I moved to a new city and to help to try to make friends I joined a pool leaque.  Over time I became close friends with a guy named Bill.  A few months later we've only hung out outside of pool night once or twice.  He then invites me to a Xmas party and I went.  I thought it was odd how a few of his friends said something along the lines of ""It's so nice to finally meet you"" but I just ignored it.  For the next 6 months I'm a part of this friend group and Bill and I end up having lunch every Saturday and then hanging out the most of the day/night. I even went to dinner one night with his family when they were in town and even got the same ""finally nice to meet you"".   

Come summertime and the group decides to rent small cabins on a lake nearby.  I call and book my cabin.  There are 3 couples, Bill and myself.  I noticed Bill acting a bit strangely and also that 2 of the 3 couples are being a bit mean and making a few snippy comments to me.  I can feel tension but I have no clue what is going on so I decide to sit on my little cabin's porch and read for most of the weekend.  The couple that had that Xmas party, the wife, Jane, was becoming a closer friend and she saw what was going on and came over to check on me.  I asked her if she knew what was going on, why they were treating me poorly but she said she didn't know but to not worry about it.  Bill got extremely drunk that night and the tension got worse.  After the weekend Bill and I still hung out just like we always did and I never asked or said anything about the weekend. 

Over time Bill and I start hanging out less and less because it became very obvious that Bill was a functioning alcoholic.  I had my suspicions but for his birthday it was clear.  After our usual Saturday lunch I took him somewhere that had no  that lasted alcohol for about 4 hours (took 1 hour to get there).  As we were driving home he literally yelled to get off at the coming exit and was kinda freaking out.  He tried to play it off as he was hungry and wanted to eat at a particular restaurant.  When we got to the restaurant he didn't even stop to talk to the hostess and went straight to the bar while I asked for a table.  That was when I was 100% there was a problem.

 Jane and I decide to do a shopping/lunch thing one Saturday and she said something that reminded me of a weird conversation I had with Bill one time.  He basically told me that when he was much younger he liked a girl and told people they were dating when they were really just friends and it blew up in his face.  It suddently hit me and I asked Jane if Bill ever told her that we were dating.  She gave me a look and then said, Bill is my friend and he's so sweet, I can't say anything bad about him.  I was dumbfounded and said, so that is why everyone treated me like shit at the lake that weekend?  What did Bill say for them all to treat me that way?  He had no way to explain it so he told them some fucked up story?  That I've lost the first group of friends after moving to a new city because he lied about everything?  She kept playing it off as no big deal and would defend him because I guess she felt bad for him.  I was so hurt.  I even said ""so I lost friends because you would rather stay friends with an alcoholic that lied to them for a year""?  Got it.

I met Bill for one last dinner but one of the wives showed up to get him to leave because I'm such a shitty person according to him.  Imagine lying to your friends for a year and how would he explain that his girlfriend got her own cabin?  It's truly sick.  

I really enjoyed that friend group.  We had so many fun times and laughs and it was heartbreaking when everyone stopped speaking to me because of his lies.  I know Jane knew and I'm guessing her husband did as well but I don't think anyone else in the friend group knew at all.

I (18 F) have apparently been dating my best friend (19 M) for an entire year but didn’t know until today. Need help asking him about it.,"So something I’ve thought a lot about recently is that younger teens often have a hard time with online adult conversations and analysis of deeper issues related to women and marginalized people overall. As in, they come across a thread or post or something about men and they get hurt, see it as a personal attack, and feel defensive and angry. It’s then really hard to get them to listen or understand the finer aspects of the issue especially if it’s something super unfamiliar to them. Which happens if it’s, let’s say, a women’s issue and we’re talking about a younger teenage guy who doesn’t spend time around girls and sees them as intimidating, or might not have good female role models. This can feed into the self esteem issues that the guy already has and then also make him think girls dislike him, while he’s also filled with resentment and avoidance.


That’s when YouTube recommendations, podcasts and other toxic content come in. They’re marketed to men who are feeling frustrated and lonely and isolated, it’s like a warm hug of “it’s not you, it’s them” and a lot of the videos seem like they’re all about self improvement and confidence.. at first. The people making these videos also simultaneously paint women and general people who disagree as unstable, irrational, hysterical, abusive, manipulative, etc. Men in general struggle with not receiving a lot of emotional support and emotional comfort (or physical affection) and these videos essentially fill that void, at least a little bit. 


Now lots of adult men will eventually pick up on the crazy parts of the videos but younger people are impressionable and the videos essentially teach them to not trust anyone else’s opinion because the world is against them. This is then validated when others react negatively to their behaviour (even if negative reactions make sense) and it pulls them further in. It’s a vicious cycle and I think they need a combination of personal self awareness, community support and emotional support to break out of it, but sometimes it’s the same people who act cruel and push everyone away and refuse help.",11ulyhm,jcp4r2o,2023-03-18 14:08:51

Once you understand that being nice or civil is a basic thing, then I would agree that becoming someone people want to be around is a good step.

Need help asking him about it.,"Sure so I work in public education, but I have also spent the last ten years teaching martial arts. My studio is often asked to teach self defense courses for local colleges, as well as groups of women. The issue with teaching self defense courses is that at the end of the day you can only impart a limited amount of martial proficiency in less than ten weeks.

The bulk of good self defense training comes in the form of teaching preventative tactics. Possibly the most valuable of these is coaching individuals in recognizing predatory behaviors. A book my studio often employs as a resource is, ""The Gift of Fear.""

The concept of forced pairing is something that predators use to create a false sense of partnership between them and their victims. In short the idea is to use team language, and manufacture a scenario in which they can create a unilaterally defined partnership. It can be as simple as saying let's get those groceries up to your apartment. We can see this here where the predator is using pet names, ""babe, sweetheart"" as well as curating scenarios where the victim feels obligation to pair with him.

Another tell tale tactic is when she is laying on the bed. One of the grooming methods employed by predators is to gradually initiate physical contact, in order to test their victims boundaries.

Finally the gas lighting tactics he employs in their final confrontation. Predators will try to make their victims feel at fault when the victim becomes uncomfortable with them. This is a way to abuse and control other people.

What's really scary about a lot of predatory behaviors is that many of these tactics are adjacent to normal communication, and can often be disregarded. However the bottom line is if you ever notice yourself in a situation that you find uncomfortable; or with someone who just doesn't feel right, you should always trust your gut. You do not owe anything to anyone. If someone seems off to you, you are perfectly justified in not dealing with them. If someone repeatedly violates your boundaries with no regard for your agency, they are dangerous. There is nothing wrong with cutting someone out with zero explanation to that person. Always value your own safety above all else.",11ulyhm,jcqpohy,2023-03-18 20:43:58

Before she even mentioned Tate, and before I even read about their convo at the coffee shop, I just KNEW it was going there.

He would have had to known kissing her like that would have thrown her for a loop, but he must’ve read or heard that doing so might put her in a position to just go along wit it.  At that point it became clear to me he made a conscious decision to simply *behave* as if she was his girlfriend as if he deserved it.

Immediately, the pervasive mentality some guys are starting to develop that they are *owed* a girlfriend (and typically one that they already have a close friendship with) came to my mind, which reeks of people like Tate and even Jordan Peterson, to an extent.

Commenter: Well, the connection between sex and pregnancy has been known since antiquity. People recognised that women who have never had sex never got pregnant.

OOP: But how did people realise that? If you see a pregnant woman, how would you know if she's had sex or not?

Commenter: ...the woman would know.

A lot of people, even otherwise well-meaning people, just kind of never consider the idea that women are also sentient and can observe the things happening around them and form their own thoughts and opinions.

This is also why men seeking advice on how to approach women get really upset when given advice like ""just treat her like a person, talk to her normally."" They say, ""I tried that and it didn't work!"" What do you mean it didn't work, you did successfully talk to her, didn't you? ""Yes, but she wouldn't go on a date with me!"" See, they're being dishonest when they say they want advice on how to talk to women. What they *really* want is advice on how to make a woman romantically interested in them, a cheat code they can plug in and get laid as a result.

And the teacher kind of looked at us like we had three heads and said, ""Because it's the right thing to do.""

And I remember the feeling of everything in my brain just... folding in and crunching together and coming out five seconds later with everything snapped into place where it fits.

We do the right thing because it's the right thing to do.  It's a tautology, and I recognized it as a tautology - and I also recognized it as absolutely, 100% true.  You aren't ""nice"" to get stuff - not from people, not from God, not from the universe.  Indeed, you aren't ""nice"" at all, because ""nice"" is performative.

And if you are kind and decent and people perceive you as nice, that's fine.  And if people treat you better because you treat them better, that's lovely, too.

For no reason anybody could tell, he killed his mother and wife, then went to the campus and started murdering people.  He killed fourteen people and wounded 31 more.

The interesting thing is that he left a suicide note in which he said that he killed his wife and mother to save them from the shame of the fact that he was about to go to the university to kill other people, and he wasn't 100% sure why, and he requested that, after the police killed him, if it was possible, they do pathology to see if there was any organic cause.

My pet theory/understanding as to how incels happen in general is related to parenting. Parents teaching their children about how to handle one-sided affection and rejection are not doing a good job at catering that lesson towards someone in the throes of a testosterone-filled puberty. The main reason is because the primary person expected to do this sort of socioemotional child rearing has never gone through it. The secondary person has either already matured 15+ years from it, or worse, learned how to cope in those same exact toxic misogynistic ways.

I know soooo many emotionally intelligent and actively involved millennial dads. Many of whom I have personally witnessed reinforcing intergender compassion and respect.

All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men. The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire… those are, overwhelmingly, other men. In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal. From women they want devotion, service and sex. 

Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving.”

>Emily looked like she was about to cry. She is neurodivergent and a lot of food taste's and textures really bother her, tomatoes being a large one. My husband doesn't seem to care

Oh EFF THAT! Insisting on a treat meal containing a food the kid can't stand is just about control and is cruel. It's literally putting food ideology before her total wellbeing. If vegetables were so important, why didn't he  tell her BEFORE ordering that she had to pick a vegetable with her meal?

What your husband actually taught your kid is ""because he said-so.""  Because if vegetables were the main part. He would have asked her to pick a vegetable as a side dish to have with her bacon burger. Even if he'd forgotten beforehand, he could have asked her what vegetable she picked. He didn't. He decided to punish a 12 year old because she didn't pick a treat meal healthy enough to his liking and ordered a food that makes her unable to eat her meal. He's 100% the AH.

Food is such a personal choice. What tastes good, what textures are liked. Teach them to be polite when eating at someone's house and how to politely decline things they don't like.

AITA for taking the vegetables of my kid's burgers?,"As a grown woman on the spectrum with some texture-flavor issues around certain foods, the way you're handling this with your daughter is perfect. My parents were like you in this with me and my brother, and because of it, I've gotten to be really good about eating a wide variety of foods these days that I wouldn't have, and in some cases, *couldn't* have eaten as a kid. Part of it was changing tastes, some of it has been gradually getting over some of the sensory issues by trying the foods in other ways, etc. Still some things I just *can't* do, even though I legitimately *WANT* to like them. 
  
Like, fuck, I'm kind of a foodie these days, thanks to my parents being flexible and understanding with me and my brother's issues involving food as kids. I wanted to like sushi SO damn bad, because it's incredibly visually appealing to me, and I like that it's a food that takes some skill to make and have look as pretty as it does. But the texture and the strong taste of the rice vinegar in it just basically short-circuit my brain and it's an instant rejection the second it hits my tongue. I've tried tons of different types and rolls, both with and without fish, and it's just something that, for whatever reason, my brain cannot get around the texture and taste of it. The ingredients on their own? No problem, it's just for whatever reason, in *that* form, I can't do it. But hey, you know what? I've given it *MORE* than a fair shot. I also can't do mayonnaise on things. Or American (and often any type of) cheese on burgers. Burgers? Hell yes. Cheese on its' own or on other things? Well, I don't care for *all* cheeses, but I fucking LOVE me some sharp-ass cheddar, oh man. But melted on a burger? Again, for whatever reason, my brain just usually HATES the texture of cheese melted on a hamburger patty. At least that one I *can* eat if I had to, I just don't really like it. 
  
Sensory issues can suck for us - they've done scans and studies of the brains of people like us on the spectrum, and we apparently have something like 10x the amount of sensory neurons and connections in our brains than neurotypical people do. I got relatively lucky in that most of my sensory issues are really minor and for the most part, a lot of sensory stuff is actually very pleasurable to me. But that stuff that sets off my brain's alarm, that stuff can range from just seriously unpleasant, to overwhelming and *painful*. My Mom is likely on the spectrum herself - it seems to run in my family. Certain smells, even if it's just ridiculously mild, tiny amounts most people wouldn't notice, will cause crippling headaches in her and she's pretty much done for the day. 
  
So yeah. I hope your husband will listen to reason on this, because it's not an issue of just being picky for us with most of this stuff. Some of these things are just flat-out *painful* to us, and it's a crapshoot as to what things will set an individual on the spectrum off.",12nozcp,jgg5ryn,2023-04-16 05:14:26

To the point if I was at a friend's house and their parent offered me a biscuit or some cake, unless one of my parents were there for me to seek approval, I'd turn it down and would get distressed if my friends parent insisted that it would be okay.

In my teens this led to me binge eating in secret, taking handfuls of laxatives and making myself sick so I didn't put any weight on. 

As I got older and moved out on my own I was still binge eating but didn't care if I put weight on so stopped taking the laxatives and making myself sick. By my late 20s I was 26 stone.

Maybe once a year, with a friend. So once I had access to a car and my own money. I went crazy. I binge ate. I'd buy a pizza and wolf it down in the carpark before going home. Sometimes I'd eat junk food and then feel like I had to eat my home cooked tea too. 
Add to that my mothers constant comments about ""do I really need that"" sandwich or biscuit and the fact that I was 6ft tall at 15 ( and a girl)  I had a huge complex about my size. I was convinced I was already obese. 

Once I left home I had zero control. I peaked just under 25 stone. I'm current just over 18 stone, in my late 30s  and dealing with a slew of health issues. I look at photos of 14 -18 year old me. I had a gorgeous frame. I just couldn't see it.  I was convinced that me being a bigger size than the other girls meant I was a massive blob.

"Do you find keto not just changing what you eat, but your relationship with food?","Just for a bit of background, I once weighed 600 pounds.  Could barely get out of bed.  Getting in the shower was dangerous.  I couldn't walk 60 steps.  I was almost one of those 600 pound life people.  I was going to die in the next year.      
           
Growing up, my mom and dad insisted that we clean our plates.  I obviously had (and still do a small degree have) a poor relationship with food.  My best friend's (and we've been best friends since 5th grade which means we have been best friends damn near 50 years) parents insisted that we clean our plates.  But my best friend's relationship with food is ""normal"".  No emotional eating and other food related crutches.    
             
I guess my point is that blame is stupid.  Blame is useless. One day, I took control of food. It was Monday November 14, 2016.  The day I started eating keto.  Is keto perfect?  Shit no. Some guy just wrote a post about chicken enchiladas that I had to remove from the mod que and now I'm going to want enchiladas. So no, keto isn't perfect.  But it's the best I've found.  Hell, keto is the tool that has helped me not just save my life, but to reshape my life.         
       
See, when you are in the mental ""blame mode"", then it's someone else's fault and if you stop and think about it, if it's someone else's fault then you are saying someone else has control.  Things in the past happened. I bet they were fucking horrible and I honest to God wish you didn't have to endure those things.     
      
But you control the fork.    
             
Yeah, you control the fork.  And once you learn that, it is freakin' liberating.  Once you figure out that you control the fork, it is like you are reborn.  No longer a slave to food but a someone who is free.  Someone who is not fucked up.     
                 
That's why keto works for me.  Keto is my Thor's Hammer.  Or my Captain America shield.  Or my crucifix against devil's food cake. Whatever analogy you want to use is cool.      
    
I think this is what your post is about. It's not really about blame, but about control.  About how no matter how you got here, keto is changing your course. Changing the direction of your life.  Oh, for some, the change is tiny.  It's just a tiny tiny variance in their life's direction, but that variance over 5 or 10 years becomes a huge change.     
      
Then for some of us, keto is an almost instant direction change. For me, the direction changed from the grave to living.  From worrying that the next chest pain was going to be the last one to believing I'm capable of anything.  Keto is the tool that allowed me to go from existing to living. If you've never just existed, then you don't know how wonderful living is.     
                           
And your post does that.  Your post reminds me of when I was eating keto and learning to live again.  Those were amazing times.  A 50 year old man excited for each and every new day. Excited because he learned to appreciate sunrises and see the beauty in each sunset.  He learned to enjoy simple.      
    
Why am I writing this now?  Because your post is wonderful.  It's wonderful because it reminds us all of at least one reason why keto helps us. Your post does something else:  It gives those newbies and lurkers something else to consider. It gives the person who is trying keto but struggling a reason to keep plugging away.       
      
At least, that's my hope, because newbie's and lurkers, we won't let you fail, so jump in.  Strugglers, ask us your questions because everyone on this sub wants you to succeed.  That's probably the coolest thing about our sub--everyone on here wants you to succeed.",1l3mjm3,mw27nz6,2025-06-05 01:43:48

That all aside: yes nowadays when everything is readily available for many people your behaviour of food might be seen as ""weird"", but personally I respect it.

"My boyfriend called me “fucking disgusting” for the way I eat chicken, and I can’t stop thinking about it.","For the first time ever I think I can one-up this story. Please don’t allow this idiot to impact your self esteem.

An ex boyfriend of mine (we remain friends to this day) had a very privileged upbringing in Nigeria. We used to eat in Nando’s a lot, and my 3 sons (5 & 6) though it was a great joke that he ordered a whole chicken for himself, and ate everything on his plate, bones and all. The restaurant staff all pulled a surprised face when clearing the table as one plate out of four was sparkling clean. The boys thought this was hilarious and openly laughed until their sides hurt watching him bite the joint from the top of the leg bone. His family was anything but poor, the difference was environmental since it was heavily frowned upon to waste food under any circumstances and his mum raised them to be grateful for everything they had.


Every English person who ate with him couldn’t believe the bones were edible. I did eat a couple to say I had tried, and they were surprisingly palatable. I never allowed the boys to eat them because I was concerned about splintering for the same reason I wouldn’t give cooked chicken bones to pets.

I’ve never known anyone specifically eat chicken marrow, but I do make sure I saw beef and lamb bones in half and boil out the marrow into the stock to make the gravy and it’s delicious. 

What a complete twonk! In my view, nobody should be labelled on the basis that they are enjoying or grateful for good food, it should be the most basic of human rights",17nh98q,k7s3145,2023-11-04 12:26:56
"My boyfriend called me “fucking disgusting” for the way I eat chicken, and I can’t stop thinking about it.","Exactly! I also grew up poor and was encouraged to break open the bone. It helps when you can't afford more nutrients. 

OP, your BF is an AH big time. I also want to say that being drunk is NO excuse for hurting someone's feelings. Is he saying he was so drunk he can't remember? Was he so drunk that he doesn't understand what he was saying? If so, he has a drinking problem. 

That's not what he's saying though, he is saying that because he was drunk you need to just not react to the hurtful things he said. I bet if you got drunk and then started telling all his gross things, he would not be happy, nor would ne let it go. 

I bet if we talked over coffee, you would have so many more red flags from him. 

You are not overreacting, I would be resentful too, and I would dump him. 

I know there is a running joke with Reddit about ""just dump him"" and if you see my comment history, I do love that train of thought. However, it's not ""over one small thing"", it's because when you tried to talk to him about your feelings he was dismissive and unwilling to see your POV. 

I have quick wit and love to ""zing"" people. My husband loves to open those doors and so I was ""zinging"" him a lot. One day he turns to me and says ""that really hurts my feelings, I feel like you are targeting me and it makes me not want to share things with you."" 

When I tell you the breath left my body, I was shook at this revelation. I never thought of my behavior as bullying. I come from a very toxic family and had to learn and relearn so much. We talked it over and now we're at a place where I can still ""zing"" him and he even gets me back. It's healthy and I know the line and never even walk near it.

There was every dish you could think of. They even brought about 6 dishes of their own. We had cold chicken, and the youngest boy asked his mum if he could still eat something about the cold chicken joints. She looked around worried until she spotted the street's ""grandfather"" eating the chicken bones too, and she pointed to him and said to her son, to go ask him. 

The street's ""grandfather"" was of mixed heritage, we never knew what, just that he and his wife had no children so we kids called them our grandparents.

"My boyfriend called me “fucking disgusting” for the way I eat chicken, and I can’t stop thinking about it.","I've always told friends (from experience), that the very first real problem you have in a relationship is indicative of what will ultimately end the relationship. It is in that moment you decide whether or not you're going to put it aside and go through the motions of the relationship anyway, or choose to recognize the incompatibility and save yourself the future heartache.

By this I mean, as others have said, this isn't about a ""chicken joke,"" but rather about the action of casually denigrating and humiliating you publicly, then refusing to take even an ounce of responsibility. He denies its effects on you and furthermore, doesn't even seem to care. *That's* your issue here, not the chicken.

If you go against your gut feelings right now, you're giving him the permission to treat you this way from this point forward because you are essentially telling him there are no consequences to his actions and you won't do anything at all to stand up for yourself. In the future, he'll not only continue this type of behavior, but push the boundaries further to see what else you give him permission to do and trust me, it'll get worse, much worse.

Respect yourself. It's been less than 6 months. Tap out. Tell him why, and don't frame it as a ""chicken joke."" Tell him that it's simply not ok to treat you that way, you **won't** be treated that way, ie, casually publicly denigrated without even a hint of consideration to your feelings, and no culpability for his actions. Do NOT let him backtrack. Be firm. Otherwise, you're still saying it's ok.

I've learned from experience that only I set the rules for how others treat me, and I see the signs early, take no shit, and give no justifications for the standards I set for myself; they are mine and mine alone.

Set the standard for yourself. Tell this dude to kick rocks and don't waste another minute on him that could go to someone who actually deserves your time because they *do* respect your standards for yourself, naturally.",17nh98q,k7s284k,2023-11-04 12:19:29

Very well said. The issue isn’t op or eating habits or a “chicken joke”—that was NOT a joke. The issue is about respect and consideration. 

Actually, I love how supportive all the responses here are. Food insecurity is serious and can create trauma that affects one’s entire relationship with food. Binge eating, food hoarding, all sorts of issues. 

My best friend grew up with abusive food insecurity and I’ve seen it all. A big one was sleep eating. (Sleep walking and eating. Food and non food like paper clips.) but probably the most pervasive is a tendency to subconsciously manipulate others into treating him to food despite making good money now. It’s just a deeply ingrained subconscious habit to try to procure food in whatever way he could. And as a child, the options were limited. those instincts don’t go away just because you grow up. But he’s slowly working on it and getting better. 

If op’s biggest issue is gratitude for food and utilizing every part possible, that’s beautiful. Not disgusting.

My daughters eating disorder is killing me financially.,"My son and I also have ARFID. He would not eat any meat besides chicken nuggets for years. When he was 7ish I had him help me make Tarragon Turkey Burgers (first time for both of us) which has shredded zucchini and ground turkey with some seasonings shaped into a patty and broiled. Surprisingly he actually tried it, and more surprisingly he really liked it. And it actually opened a window into him actually eating more meat based foods. And to add meat to pasta. He loves Hamburger Helper. He found flavors he likes and it's the same every time.

The key is trying new things when you feel like you can, with no pressure involved. My Mom would make meals and she generally cooked things always the same recipe, so if you liked it, it was always safe to eat, with the exception of meat because each piece is always a crapshoot. But there was usually something each dinner that was edible for me and she never made us clean our plates or take things that we didn't like. New stuff she'd just ask us to try a bite or two. And if for some reason I didn't like anything, she wouldn't cook a new/different meal for me, but she would let me have some snacks. Peanut butter bread was a go to (in fact my brown bag lunch for school was a peanut butter sandwich literally every single day from 1st through 8th grade and I'm so glad that peanut allergies weren't prevalent at that time because I don't know what I would have actually been able to eat that entire time).",1ajo6lf,kp5fasy,2024-02-06 07:47:43
My daughters eating disorder is killing me financially.,"do you have access to food banks or the uk version of food stamps?  bc that's what id' suggest if you were in the states.  not for her, but for you and the rest of your family to supplement her eating.  

in the arfid and chronic illness communities im part of, which have an overlap in not having an appetite/nausea toward food, as well as in the loss of nutrition that comes with it, there's often a saying:

""fed is best.  nutrition comes next.""  so i'd suggest making sure she can be fed, consistently.  and then that gives you space to work out ways to help her increase the health.  this is really hard on low income, i know.  at my sickest point, i couldn't afford any food that was appetizing.  the few things i could afford made me cry trying to shove down my throat, or made me sick from bad ingredients.  

a good way to work with arfid is to not shame any food choices, to be honest if you sometimes don't like it too.  but to model being brave and trying a food (without expecting the child to also try it- but cool if they do).  and to model putting it out, trying a few, and saying you can try this too if you like!  another thing that can help is the parent modeling that they enjoy the foods, oh this is so good, oh i love how my body feels when i eat these blueberries!  etc.  

you can look up ""arfid"" on instagram and probably find some good accounts.  there are grownups with arfid out there trying new foods, there are children's nutritionists showing healthy ways to help a child expand their palate without stressing you both out more and creating more food trauma. 

i can't recommend anyone specifically off the top of my head.  but there's ideas out there.  you'll probably get the most help by watching others working through this and finding ways to inch her toward more foods.  even a couple foods would help you here.  it can be slow though!  if you go too fast, you could just overwhelm her.

she likely eats that way in part bc the other foods literally taste nasty to her body.  so help her body learn to like things.  please never trick or force her- my mom did that shit and it caused me a LOT of long time issues.

I ended up distrusting specific food for the weirdest reasons and refused to eat them after that.

No idea if this will help you but for me it was a trust issue, i didn't trust certain foods (still don't, no idea why) and would refuse to eat them.
This got worse after my mom tried to trick me into eating problem foods by hiding them and then later saying something like ""ha you ate it just fine, i knew you could do it) it had the opposite effect on me.

The thing that helped me start moving away from this downwards spiral was that my parents got divorced and when i was at my dads from around 9 years old he would clearly ask me what i wanted to eat, suggest something else and tell me step by step the ingredients and have me watch him cook.

Like before i could eat raw veg but didn't like any boiled veg so my mom just gave me a whole lettuce but my dad would show me a salad is just a lettuce in pieces etc.

When i was around 16 my mom forced me to cook for myself bec she got tired of it and i started experimenting with safe ish new things and learned to eat a bunch more.

Before then i would not eat any red veg, most boiled veg, most non domestic veg, no meat besides hotdogs and chicken breast, cheese, bread, basic condiments.

But there is a subreddit which is some sort of pro-ana edging/orgasm denial fetish. What mostly seems to be young and possibly teenage girls post pictures of their skeletal bodies, announce how long since theyve last eaten (always too long) and ask if they ""deserve"" to edge/maturbate. 

Then men comment and tell them they can if they dont eat for another x hours, or get their weight down another x pounds. Give pro-ana type advice as orders from a ""dom"".

I have nothing against people who want to participate in denial kink online,  if everyone is consenting then why not use reddit to fulfil that desire, if you dont like it dont look etc. 

BUT encouraging an EATING DISORDER is NOT safe sane consensual or risk aware kink. Plus I think its pretty dark to get off on such an extreme version of it. Like I get that a lot of people get off on reflecting misogyny/patriarchy etc in their BDSM, and again, none of my business. To be getting off on it when at the other end of the interaction is a young, vulnerable, malnourished girl with a major eating disorder makes all the ""you dont deserve to cum, your body is mine"" shit feel SO foul. eating disorder usually involve obsessive belief systems and habits and disconnect from reality.

Eating disorder fetish (trigger warning),"Normal people aren’t assholes. 

Speaking as someone who has suffered with ED & other disorders.

These disorders are incredibly difficult to deal with, the pain & suffering is unbearable for the effected person - I know how awful it is to bare, I can completely understand how that would be too much for someone. 

It’s too much for myself to deal with - something that is at times so out of my control - let alone having to be a loved one, watching as I suffer & being helpless to make it stop. 

Can you imagine how absolutely devastating & heartbreaking it is to watch the person you love dying in front of you because their sickness tells them they can’t eat. 

It is a lot to go through, it’s completely understandable that many people simply can’t put themselves through it. 

Also remember that this is typically people in the dating stage who chose not to. 

Most loved ones to the victims of ED will often have to just watch & hope things get better (as even with the best support recovery is tough) 

But even when those loved ones cannot bare it, I can understand why unfortunately. 

There is nothing they can really do to help or fix it. That’s a tough predicament to be in. 
The biggest thing you can do to support someone with an ED is learn to listen. You can't solve it for them, and they don't want you to. They just need to know that you love and support them. That and watch to make sure that their weight doesn't get too low. If it does, get them help

I’m glad I recovered, though relapse is always a battle.  However I know many people who never recovered or that have lasting damage to this day - living on ventilators or eventually dying due to complications from long durations of ED. ",1fpzyx9,lp3m17v,2024-09-26 23:08:31

My eating disorder was a choice.,"I feel like it's more complicated than that. *A lot* of teenage girls decide they're going to be anorexic, it's super common. However most do not actually become anorexic. Most people don't even have the capacity to make themselves restrict to the point of anorexia (and that's a good thing - having your brain intervene so you don't starve to death is a good trait to have). 

You grew up in a culture where being thin is valued and where young girls often associate anorexia = thin = good and so you, like many, decided you wanted to be anorexic. However, you did not choose everything else about yourself, the social, psychological, biological factors that made it so that you actually did develop anorexia. And no 13-year-old truly understands the long-term consequences of their choices, let alone everything that anorexia actually entails.

So you chose it, but did you really, in any meaningful sense of the word?

You're definitely allowed to feel however you want about it, but personally, having done the same thing when I was 12, I think it's a whole lot more complicated than a real choice. Maybe I chose to start restricting when I was 12, but at that point to me all it really meant was that I would get even skinnier than I already was. I absolutely did not choose the lifetime of an eating disorder that would follow, completely upending my life, health, and relationships, and destroying all other goals I had for my life.",15hlcov,jupyf38,2023-08-04 04:36:12

I feel like a case could potentially be made for this statement, but this post almost goes to show how much this wasn't a choice.  I know the reality is difficult, but please don't further confuse yourself with the notion that picking your coping method of choice makes it a choice.

* Makes food for other people and doesn't eat any, especially likes making dinner and then pulling the ""I ate while I was cooking and am full""
* Spending lots of time cooking/thinking/planning about a meal/food... like spending days planning a meal...
* Obsessing over macros, once I was in class and someone jokingly asked how many calories in a Tums... and without thinking, I asked what version it was and repeated the calories for each of them...
* Always eating... but never really eating... like constantly having a snack and sorta kinda eating it... but taking way, way too long... like I use to sit in a three hour long evening course, and eat like two cheese sticks... and drink a low cal green smoothie... and man, I made it look like I was eating a full blown meal...",1k7v97w,mp39ug8,2025-04-26 03:45:34

Vomit breath

“I couldn’t pull that off”. Not a dead giveaway, but I’d keep an eye out after hearing that. 

Being health conscious without other lifestyle choices. Diet without gym? Awful grades and work ethic but still prioritize ‘healthy’ food? Choosing cardio over muscle development???

Calorie focus + clueless about other macros

Signs someone has an eating disorder?,"It’s a bit strange that she ominously whispered that she caught onto you having an ED? That’s something you bring up privately with someone if you’re concerned about them, not whispered publicly as a “gotcha.” 

Only way I can rationalize it is that she might have an ED too and ik ED brain can mess with decision making sometimes. Or she was excited to potentially find a friend who was going through something similar.

Either way, don’t let this slide. If she doesn’t bring it up again, bring it up with her and see if she has good intentions. Her having the wrong intentions can end very very badly such as her telling your other friends or purposefully trying to trigger you. If she really does seem like a sweet person when you talk about it with her then you’ve gained someone to confide in which is invaluable! Sure, a subreddit helps, but if you have someone irl to talk to it’s a type of support that’s hard to find.

Edit: I just reread and noticed that she’s not even your friend. Wtf?? Even if she had good intentions that’s not something you say to an acquaintance 💀",1k7v97w,mp25i7u,2025-04-25 23:40:14

Realized I Developed an Eating Disorder - A Word of Warning,"The switch to maintenance can be very hard. After a long time in a deficit you get used to the mindset and it's scary to break. I know it was for me.

One realization I had to accept is that I've never had a healthy relationship with food. I didn't have one when I was gaining to morbid obesity, and I didn't have one while restricting for over a year and a half. Yes, the weight loss was needed for my health, but the mindset of constant restriction isn't a healthy mindset for a lifetime of eating. It's only been in maintenance that I've finally started to learn what healthy looks like.

One thing that helped me was realizing that I wasn't always binging when I overate. I have watched my calorie intake a lot as I've been trying to let hunger guide me. Some days I naturally undereat and others I overeat. It all balances out though. I bet you know naturally skinny people who do the same thing. It's a normal and healthy eating pattern. What isn't healthy is to consider each time a binge. That leads to a pattern of restriction and actual binges. 

The biggest thing I can tell you is to remember that you lost the weight, you know how to lose, so you can always lose again if you gain weight. Let yourself have a range to try to sit in, and remember you can control it if you go over that range. It would only take a week or two to do so. 

Lastly, even on sedentary days you might have a higher tdee than being sedentary. Trust the math. You lost the weight by trusting the math, you will maintain by trusting the math. Like even when you feel fat or like you shouldn't, trust the math anyways. 

I don't know if that helps at all, but trust me that you're not alone. Besides myself, both Jordan Shrinks and obese to beast are people on YouTube who lost a lot of weight and dealt with eating disorders afterwards. They've made some videos about it and how they got through it. It might help to look them up.

Not to mention the random events like the egg bar party, Burts going away party, Irvings ""funeral"" party, waffle party, they seem to really understand the power that food has over a person and use it well. The work is too important, they dont want them worrying about being hungry or not focusing because of hunger. Its made pretty clear that they are well provided for in terms of office amenities. They even made it a point to ""upgrade"" the snacks in the vending machines. There are limits with the tokens, so that there is some control, so people dont go crazy with the snacks, you are there to work, not eat non stop, but they clearly dont want you to feel hungry.",1jchglh,mi3hyze,2025-03-16 15:03:25

Helena's eating disorder is telling us something more sinister,"Helly’s instincts were always spot on and it makes even more sense learning who she really is, because her outtie has a much deeper understanding of the depths of the evils at Lumon.

From the first moment as an innie, everyone and everything is trying to teach her to ignore her instincts about how bad things are.

Instinctually, she understood that escaping at all costs was worth it and it took a lot to break her from that so she learns to operate “within her bounds.”  I don’t think she ever gave up her desire to escape/destroy Lumon.",1jchglh,mi394db,2025-03-16 14:15:08

Helena's eating disorder is telling us something more sinister,"Not necessarily. People can end up disliking a food for psychological reasons and not taste reasons, like experiencing a bad memory associate with the food or being forced to eat it so much they shift from liking to disliking it.

Helly enjoying her devilled egg is her as she would be without her baggage, without being forced to consonantly eat eggs (likely many times raw from the pressure of her father) because of the cult she's trapped in. A devilled egg without trauma despite her circumstanced, without the association and grown hatred of it.",1jchglh,mi41ifs,2025-03-16 16:43:37
Helena's eating disorder is telling us something more sinister,"The other main theory is that she cut her eggs up like that to lengthen the amount of time she got to spend with her father, that although he's cold he's all she has in terms of trying to experience any kind of familial love. Okay I explained it pretty badly but it's something like that.",1jchglh,mi48per,2025-03-16 17:19:19
Helena's eating disorder is telling us something more sinister,"I don't think it necessarily implies either. Helena can have an eating disorder developed (presumably) out of wanting control over one simple thing in her life and needing to look as perfect as possible for the company and the media, and Helly wouldn't automatically have it as well. Outie Mark is an alcoholic, but would innie Mark be one as well if he had access to alcohol? Their disorders are caused by outside factors the innies don't personally struggle with. 

I guess the second implication could be exaggerated and claimed by Lumon, but I think it's just a side effect of the innies being the same base person without the struggles and traumas that shaped the outies so much.

It looks like all Helly knows is hunger, and continuing to starve herself as her outie does ultimately only punishes herself. Makes sense that she'd eat as she pleases and only hurt/threaten to hurt herself when it would **really** impact her outie.",1jchglh,mi3hreu,2025-03-16 15:02:18

When Helena mentioned telling him about what happened at the ORTBO, Natalie and Mr Drummond said they wouldn't inform him of it. I doubt Jame would willingly let Helena go back down to the severed floor if he knew Helly would be in control for 8 hours a day. Also, aside from the bathroom scene from the S1 finale, there was also a cut scene from the script where he sees the security footage of Helly and Mark kissing and calls her a bitch. He likely sees Helly as a completely separate entity from his daughter, or possibly a corrupted form of her (like the Dieter Eagan story). I'm not 100% sure what he's referring to during the scene in last week's episode, but I think, overall, the lack of control he has over his daughter while she's on the severed floor deeply bothers him.",1jchglh,mi2sbyr,2025-03-16 12:26:20

Helena's eating disorder is telling us something more sinister,"It's a very interesting meditation on who you are outside of your environment, and how you cannot truly separate yourself from those experiences. Helena's wish to rebel is controlled in her real life by her having power over others, even when others obviously have controlled and abused her. That extends over to Helly, as well, because Helly is someone Helena can exert power over directly. Helena is also how Helly would act if she were powerless; if she were treated the way that she is by her father (which echoes some of the treatment of severed workers) but not given her position at Lumon or control over others, she would get more courage to rebel.

  
It's cool throughout this show how we see radicalism - interpersonally - and how it is tempered and neutered through giving people the right amount of power. Cobel was fine being taken advantage of when she managed the severed floor, Milchick obviously sees flaws and issues at Lumon but wants his position and career. Mark Scout has a rebellious streak that seems to have never really been shown until Petey disappeared and he became manager and was pushed into it, a powerless character gaining more courage because they are out of options. Lumon's psychological manipulation seems to both understand this and underestimate it (assuming Mark and Cobel and everyone else are in some way successful). Dylan is another case, where his innie is more motivated and less beaten down by life; he hasn't gone through the depression and the struggle that his outie has and hasn't developed his bad habits from his environment.",1jchglh,mi3gsl2,2025-03-16 14:57:09

I’ve got a compulsive skin picking problem, I’ll just stand at a mirror and pick at my face, chest, arms, legs for hours if left alone. My sweet baby, my Echo-Cat, since I found her over a year ago, she’s taken up the habit of kneading biscuits on my legs/butt with her claws out and yelling at me if she catches me doing it. She’ll follow me to the bathroom, sit with me, then walk me out or wait at the door. If I don’t follow her out, she’ll come back for me. She’s started doing it now also to my partner and roommate when they’re in the bathroom, though, which is a little silly but I do worry that I’ve instilled some anxiety in her.

I’ve always been a bit heavy, and my regular exercise to vaguely keep it in check was in a group setting, which came to an abrupt halt in March of ‘20. And my exercise was getting more minimal, because of increasingly arthritic knees and some asthma. 

My dog will not poop in the (fenced-in, and clearly his) yard, he *must* go for a walk to poop. Sometimes he needs to walk a good while before he’ll go. Our normal walk loop is 2 - 2.5 miles, including some hills, we do that twice a day. So because of him, I have to walk 4 - 5 miles a day, regardless of weather, and that level of cardio has, I believe, kept me in some vague definition of ‘shape’, and quite possibly alive in general.

They make some with two compartments per day and some with four per day. I need the four personally but you might just need the two. As soon as I wake up, no matter when that is, I take the first pill. Since that one is a timed pill before I can eat anything and the rest get taken with food, I wait the time and then take the others right before eating. The third compartment gets taken either in the afternoon or at bedtime with compartment four depending on how late I woke up and at what point in the day I remembered to take my bulk pills from compartment two. It’s not a perfect system and I often mess it up so don’t expect it to be a perfect solution but it might help.

Making a few small swaps (such as switching out soda) is how you stay healthy without having to do a super regimented diet all the time. There’s a balance to be found between teaching kids to make healthy choices and making them so concerned about calories that they stop eating altogether. And there are so many reasons kids shouldn’t have sodas from the sugar to the caffeine. Also there are plenty of people who abstain from soda for religious or other reasons that if you are hosting children who’s parents you don’t know that well I’d say it would be safer to err on the side of just don’t serve it.,nhxtam,gyzrir7,2021-05-21 22:09:50

AITA for having flavored sparking water at my teenage daughter's birthday party? Another mom accused me of trying to give her daughter an eating disorder.,"lol, this what my first thought reading this too. ""Artificial replacement for soda"" beacuse soda is such a natural whole food? Soda is obviously artificial, you know a man made product that dosen't occur in nature.

And this woman has major issues around food and eating which sadly she is messing up her kids with, by making scenes like this, not letting them eat anything low in calories, and having big emotional issues around food. 

There is nothing wrong with kids eating ""diet"" products. So long as by diet products one means more healthy alternatives to junk food (soda) like she seems too? I mean obviously you wouldn't want to give kids drugs to lose weight. But if if someone baked low sugar muffins with whole wheat flour and their kid ate and liked them, would they really be upset about that?

And it's a ""diet"" food to this woman who is used to having soda on the regular, but to some people it's just what they eat. It's like the people who judge someone for having a salad, that they must be on a diet, that they have unhealthy ideas about eating, blah blah. But really, some of like salads. I don't always order salads, but sometimes I do and really enjoy them. She basically thinks no one should be allowed to eat or serve food that is healthier or lower calorie then what she personally chooses to eat beacuse if so they're trying to force ""diet culture"" on her kid.  Only what is a diet food for her may just be part of other people's normal foods they eat, without it being about their weight. She's making it about weight, you aren't.

And the fact that she could see a meal with pizza, burgers, guac, etc and say since there was not soda too it's a diet meal is a bit crazy. Her thinking is warped. NTA.",nhxtam,gyz8wf7,2021-05-21 19:40:01

AITA for having flavored sparking water at my teenage daughter's birthday party? Another mom accused me of trying to give her daughter an eating disorder.,"I've never heard the term cordial used in the context you mentioned!

I've made spiced elderberry cordials before too. There's a wild cherry in my back garden that produces the smallest cherries with the biggest stones, but when boiled in sugar syrup then strained made the most scrumptious red cordial. Not particularly cherry-ish but wonderfully fruity.

If you're looking to buy it (UK based) Belvoir is a really good brand. Or Rocks for a more traditional squash (so lemon, orange, or blackcurrent, with the added bonus of being Organic). Other brands are available, but if I'm not making it those are usually my go-to!

Emily is exploiting her child’s eating disorder for job security & it’s disgusting.,"I do kind of like ARFID becoming a more talked about topic on reality TV, but in the context of a child and also being randomly brought up multiple times in episode 1 for a story line, yes it’s exploitative. However, I do honestly think if sharing a story can help other parents who are like “why is my child such a picky eater??” realize there’s more to it than being picky, that’s at least good. 

I grew up being a “picky eater”, realizing now I had severe ARFID. Constantly gagging, being so sensitive to smells, not eating anything even if I was starving, being severely deficient in vitamins wasn’t normal, yet it was labelled as no big deal by my doctor. I also had raging ADHD. But I did well in school so again, everything was just written off as a quirk, until those quirks wreaked havoc on my 20s.

I think the difference in my mind with those 2 examples is their advocacy is not their storyline. They are vocal and involved outside of their shows. And public figures, even housewives or those that fist pumped their way through their 20s, can bring a lot of awareness to their communities. The non-show advocacy by Heather and Jenni can also be better controlled to protect their children rather than relying on awful Bravo producers to cherry pick statements and scenes.",1m06a8z,n3716q2,2025-07-15 02:49:51

BTW given how severe her sons ARFID is other kids notice. Her announcing it won't make him more bullied. It is obvious he doesn't eat like typical. My oldest is teased for the same lunch every single day. Peers NOTICE even in kinder.

Emily is a bitch but if one parent realizes hey my kid has this or one ped familiarizes themselves with ARFID I am glad she spoke up.

"7 months pregnant, OB tells me I've gained too much weight. (Tw: eating disorders)","The flipside: during my first pregnancy I was a *barf MACHINE*.  I lost weight during the first 4-5 months.  I gained slowly after that, though, thanks to crystallized ginger, my mother-in-law's home-brewed sassafras tea and a very careful selection of fruits and meats. Including strawberry milkshakes made with a crapton of fresh strawberries, which I promise is relevant to all this.  I began my pregnancy as a tall 127 lbs. By month seven I was inching towards 140.

And then I made the mistake of drinking one of those strawberry shakes before being tested for gestational diabetes. 

The test came back as a Probably Yes, and they immediately scheduled me for daily at-home diabetes tests and a visit with a nutritionist, who promptly sat me down and warned me sternly that I Just Cannot Keep OverEating Like This.  The baby would be born with a head the size of a bowling-ball, he said. The baby would run the risk of all sorts of mental and physical problems, he said. Just starting out! Not even born yet! And it's bad for you of course, he said. Eating junk food like this. Fatty foods. Sugars. Cakes.   

In short, it was essential that I cease my gorging immediately, and transition onto an 1100-calorie per day diet. 

&nbsp;

Which was super funny, because I remembered my mom doing Weight Watchers when I was a kid. At 5'8"", her target for healthy weight-loss was 1200 calories/day. 

&nbsp;

Long story short: fuck this shit, okay? My daily tests confirmed that I wasn't diabetic. My ob/gyn confirmed that 1100/day was indeed a weight-loss plan for a woman of my height, at my stage of pregnancy, and firmly advised against it.   Some doctors are just absolutely nuts when it comes to women's weight during pregnancy. That's all this is, and I'm so sorry you had this shitty experience.",1g9n5tk,lt8htmi,2024-10-22 20:58:33

I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,">**I** don't deserve this cat...

Your cat disagrees.

She is saying, ""Today you, tomorrow me.""

But.  When you're facing a mental health crisis, you need two things -- the unconditional support of a friend, and also the clinical assistance of a professional.  The catch is that no one person (or loyal being of any kind) can be both things.

You have a friend who is there to support you.  But just as she would need you to take her to the vet if she needed urgent care, she also needs you to take yourself to seek professional help.  Maybe you are already doing this.  Maybe you were once but now you need to find a way to do it over Zoom or whatever.  Whatever the case may be, you are the human and you are the kitten, at the same time, in need of care.

You can do this.  You are not trapped.  It's a hard road but you can take each step one at a time.",mpi934,guaplkj,2021-04-12 20:48:12

So thank you, for putting it so bluntly, picking it apart and giving such a thoughtful reply. I think part of me feels like it's my fault she's not eating... That I've done this to her. 

I had a conversation with a friend about it... It went like this...

Him- she's just not hungry, it's fine
Me- she's really skinny, it's not fine, she needs to eat
Him- na, she doesn't, she will eat when she wants to
Me- she's severely underweight!
Him- she's not starving, she looks fine
Me- you can feel all of her bones, she's not fine
Him- yeah but she looks better like that
Me- wtf?!
Him- see? It's not fine is it. Now you know how we feel. Annoying isn't it...

I've told other people and they all laugh because it's such a similar situation... But it's not. They didn't watch me day by day, or even week to week... But I think maybe the similarities in our situations make me feel even more guilt. Because my friends feel like this is something I should've just snapped out of and that it's my own fault.

I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"No problem lol (and don't worry I'm no one's therapist lol, just trying to help you see it for what it really is)

I've lived my entire life seeing what this kind of thing is like for people, even experienced it myself in my own way. It's not really something people tend to understand unless they've been through something similar. 

There's even people in wheelchairs that get harassed by strangers because the stranger assumes that it's being faked. This is obviously an extreme example but it happens a lot more than you'd think. 

Still though don't look down on that stranger, or your friends, for feeling this way. They don't have to understand because there's no need for them too, at least in the sense that it won't help them because it's not something they have to go through. 

Instead of being upset at them for feeling the way they do, try and accept them and teach them instead. You never know, they might even have a reason for feeling as such (in my example above it could be that person had a parent who faked the disability). 

The truth is though, they only see it through their own eyes and in their own way. There's a chance they'll never even understand but that's okay because they do see something is wrong and are trying to communicate, in their own way, to you that they're concerned. The person who said that didn't say it for any negative reasons other than just to try and show you how concerned they are and how they feel seeing you go through this. They're showing you they care and trying to give you their eyes. 

They can't understand completely (thus they don't see the differences) but they can try to share with you how they feel about it (thus they say it's similar, because to them, it is)",mpi934,guaxsxn,2021-04-12 21:51:59
I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"Hun. A relapse could mean *your* death. And your cat understands this. 

Remember watching her get skinnier every day? Worrying about her not eating? All those panicked trips to the vet trying to figure out what was going on? Thinking she was sick, maybe dying? 

*Your cat is seeing the very same thing with you.* Shes watching you not eat. Shes scared you're sick or dying. She sees how deathly thin you get.  But she doesn't have the ability to rush you to the doctor and pay for tests and exams and food changes. 

The same anxiety you have over her, shes having over you. 

Your her human. She loves you. She's scared for you. If you die, shes not going to know what to do. 

Momma cats, when their babies go without food, will often starve themselves so their babies can eat. Your cat is doing this to you right now. If you don't eat, she won't either. Its a choice shes actively choosing to make because she *wants* you to live and get strong and healthy. The same way you want her to. 

You absolutely deserve this loving cat. Its clear that she would be lost without you and the strong bond you share.

Eating disorders aren't easy. No disorder is easy. But, take it one step at a time. If all you can manage is a single carrot, it still counts. It still shows your cat you're trying to eat. 

If you haven't already, and you're able to, look into therapists that specialize in eating disorders. It helps. Take every day one step at a time. A single carrot. A half bowl of cereal. A small salad. Every piece you keep down is a success. 

Don't look at it as *failing* because you aren't done trying yet. Its just another step in the right direction. And you will get there eventually. I believe in you. So does your cat.",mpi934,guasvq7,2021-04-12 21:13:12

Involved/concerned/affected? Someone else commented that how I feel watching Lily fade day by day is how she sees me... And it made me think.

Thank you... Weirdly, I feel like this is a wake up call. Its been absolutely breaking my heart watching her fade away. I never even thought that it'd be breaking hers too.

I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"Exactly and very well said.

I'm a very strong believer in never apologizing or criticizing anyone for how they feel because even if I don't understand it, there's very likely a reason for it (and even if there isn't that's okay). 

I've spent a lot of my life chasing the illusion of always understanding others and I learned that acceptance is so much more important. For example: My best friend is high functioning autistic. Even though he's like a brother to me his brain literally functions completely different from mine and there's a lot about him I'll never understand. But accepting him and accepting his emotions was what truly mattered anyways, it just took me a while to realize that.

Anyways I'm kinda rambling now lol but I hope this helps.",mpi934,gub19hs,2021-04-12 22:20:39
I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"You can do this. Animals are amazing. They are sensitive and intelligent. Cats have an instinct to do things like this. If you’ve heard of cats catching birds and mice or whatnot and bringing them to humans, that’s because they believe that you need help to catch food to eat (they think we are rather dumb naked kittens at times....). Your cat is doing a variation of that. You are a part of her pack and she feels you are part of her responsibility. So don’t feel guilt. She’s looking out for you the same way you look out for her. She knows she has the strength to help you because she can see the strength you have. 

I’ve known... many cats. A lot. Cats who come from “”bad”” backgrounds where they are fighting for survival tend to just eat all the food in front of them at once. Cats who have been well taken care of and feel secure for a longer period of time will eat only what they need and not an ounce more. For instance, I can put my cat Athenas favorite food in front of her and she’ll eat a few bites and leave the rest for later. 

This is just to say, your cat has confidence in you and your ability to take care of her. She trusts you and doesn’t feel scared or anxious about her own survival. She sees the food there and knows the food will be there tomorrow and the day after. That is something you should be proud of. She loves you, trusts you, and feels safe with you. Don’t guilt yourself too much (I understand why you are though, I won’t invalidate those feelings), think instead of how safe and secure you’ve helped this cat feel. Safe enough that she wants you to feel the same way 💕💕 

You deserve this cat because of the work you put in to earn that love and trust from her. She’s giving it right back to you.

When I first got Lily, she had been badly mistreated. She had been starved for so long that her body can't even tolerate most foods so has to have a special diet. And for ages, she ate every single drop of food, so quickly that it made her ill. She also growled relentlessly whilst eating so I couldn't get near her. It never even occurred to me how much of a drastic shift that's been. She eventually stopped growling, and ate smaller amounts when needed. I remember being so proud because I knew it meant that she finally knew she would have food again. I forgot...

If you were concerned for her, you could have just told her that you wouldn’t be offended if she preferred to step down if being in the wedding was creating any extra pressure. You could’ve told her you want her there and happy and would support her in whatever that means. 

But you wanted her out of the wedding so it doesn’t create a headache for you if she relapses or can’t maintain a size. It was not motivated by her or her health. Why didn’t you anticipate this before asking her? This was perhaps the worst possible outcome. Now she has a visible sign of her failure tied to her weight and health which has led to her exclusion from her sisters even before a relapse. Very insensitive and risky choice on your part.

Also, you should be able to reflect as an adult on whether the dieting during childhood was really a better choice for her “health” because I’m mighty suspicious of that. What health issues did she have that required a diet? A clogged artery at 15?",kl5el7,gh6x2a8,2020-12-27 15:38:49

Not only that, but your objections aren't because of her health. You're bothered by the chance that she could inconvenience you by checking into a rehab facility, or by needing her dress refitted.

No matter what she says, her feelings are still going to be hurt because she is dealing with an eating disorder and body image issues that are so hellish that unless you have had the same issues you can't possible understand completely and there is no wrong in that. Most people can't as they are not trained to handle these things.

Just call up your sister, tell her you love her no matter what, and invite her out for some quality sister time just the two of you and reconnect. 

I wish you both the very best.",kl5el7,gh7im3h,2020-12-27 18:55:11

You aren't doing it for her own good, you're doing it for your vanity. You could've ask how she's doing then after hearing she's struggling, given her encouragement. ""Hey I get it, want help getting on a healthy track? Then that bridesmaid dress will be the ultimate reward!"" It could've been bonding between you two.

However by removing her from your party, you’ve created a new reason for her to relapse. Instead of being around skinny ppl and feeling bad, now she’s been excluded from something which could trigger her eating disorder. 

You should have sat her down and had a gentle conversation with her to build her up and prepare her for the upcoming dress fitting activities instead of kicking her out. Or figured out how she managed to stay healthy and helped her get back on track.

You said several things in there that are pretty shitty and those didn't spring up suddenly out of nowhere. You didn't ASK HER about how she felt about being bridesmaid. Most of your phrasing is concern over your day and having a non-thin person ruin it, except you've couched it in platitudes that make it look like you're a good person worried for her. As a now fat person, we get that sort of ""It's for YOUR OWN GOOD"" nonsense a lot and most of the time it's just unexamined, internalized fatphobia.

Huh.

I didn't think that your family was a root/ significant cause of her eating disorder... But after your negative behavior here, I'm honestly thinking you guys are.

She has a history of an eating disorder and your family thinks it's a good idea to gift her *clothing*? And then you get mad because she *ruined Christmas*? And you're going to *try* to see her point of view? 

And when you see her gain weight, the first thing you do is kick her out of your bridal party? With the full support of your mom and sisters? 

Is she always the odd one out? She already feels like it because she looks different. And obviously you guys treat her differently. Just from the things you've stated here. Would you have kicked out any of your other sisters if they gain weight? Or would you have actually talk to them? Giving them an option? 

It's like you're not treating her as a person anymore. She's just ""your sister with an ED"". You sound like you blame her for her ED and you resent her moments of relapsing.

But the two main relapse has you listed here have very reasonable triggers. 

Her having a meltdown on Christmas over being gifted clothing was an obvious asshole move on whoever gave her those clothing.

And her gaining weight during 2020 is something almost everybody is dealing with right now because of lockdown and quarantine. You guys should have seen this coming miles away and reached out to support her. Instead you wait until the last minute, took one look at her, and decided she's not worth the trouble. 

You, your sisters, and your mom have all played a part in contributing to her eating disorder. And as long as you refuse to admit your part in it, you'll always be a negative influence in her life. 

Look at how you reacted to her weight gain right NOW. As a full-grown, functioning adult *this* is how you chose to treat someone with an eating disorder. Do you really think your behavior before this was any *better*? 

THIS is just the first time you're being called out on your shit by someone outside of your family (fiance) as you guys have clearly been ignoring what your father has been trying to tell you this whole time. I also really hate that you're dismissing his opinion just because you're saying she's his ""favorite"". 

She's not his favorite, he just knows she needs someone in her corner the fight against y'alls asshole behavior. 

YTA

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"
Obviously some of the commenters have never had to deal with siblings that have mental health issues.

Your sister is relapsing. That is awful. When she does relapse, OP said that her sister is flaky. Why would she want someone who might not even show up to be in her wedding. OP is worried about dress fittings pushing her sister further down the ED hole. That is a valid fear.

And also, it sounds like your sister has been battling an ED for a long time. Honestly? That takes a toll on the siblings. Both of my siblings have health problems and my needs were pushed to the side growing up. I didn't get as much attention or one on one care because my parents were always occupied with my siblings. And I get it! I understand why.

 But I also understand being tired of everything revolving around your siblings illness, and the negative impacts it has. A wedding is supposed to be all about the couple.

What do you guys think is gonna happen if her sister remains a bridesmaid?

-The fittings will absolutely harm her self esteem. Don't kid yourself on that.

-She might not even show up, which leaves OP with a huge problem, plus all of her family will be focusing on the sister instead of the couple actually getting married.

-If the sister does show up, she may spend half the time in the bathroom crying or having a meltdown. In that case, family will go to her and try to comfort her, instead of celebrating the bride and groom.

All OP wants is her wedding to go smoothly and be about her and her hubby. It would put less pressure on her sister to have her not be a bridesmaid, and yes the wedding would go smoother if the sister was just a normal guess.

And for all you ignorant ducks who are calling her a fat shamer, it's clear you've never dealt with siblings or family members with eating disorders or other mental health problems. It is extremely hard for families as well, siblings in particular. 

NAH, your sister has a right to be sad, but ultimately I understand why you're doing what you're doing.",kl5el7,gh7jg9v,2020-12-27 19:02:13
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"YTA, why did you just ask her what SHE wants instead of deciding what's best for her on her behalf? 

Also 20 lbs is really not that much compared to the possibilities. That's the difference between a healthy weight and, well, still a healthy weight. It's not like she went up to 400 lbs, but even if she did it's still shitty to do that to someone solely based on their appearance. No wonder she has an eating disorder, with her mother trying to get her on a diet at a young age and her sister making a big deal over a measly 20 lbs as if she's some gargantuan whale because of it, which is probably exactly how she feels. By the way, I really don't buy that your decision was about her mental health. If that were the case you wouldn't have hurt her feelings intentionally. Your concern lies not with her safety, but the affect on your reputation by being seen as someone you deem to be fat. What would it have at all to do with her mental health if you had just allowed her to be in the wedding regardless of her appearance like a normal person? 

Don't be surprised when she never speaks to you again. I hope for her sake she cuts you the hell out of her life, because THAT would be the right move for her mental health.",kl5el7,gh6zpzz,2020-12-27 16:05:28
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"Probably going to get downvoted but NAH. There are too many land mines in this situation for you to have navigated it without stepping on one. I see three scenarios that all would have played out badly no matter what

1. Don’t invite her to be a bridesmaid at all, which means she feels excluded and potentially ties this to her weight.

2. Invite her which means she has to go thru fittings and whatnot which is potentially triggering.

3. What actually happened, wherein you wanted to include her but ultimately decided based on warning signs you’re seeing that you’re concerned for her health and asked her to step down.

Between the three I don’t see any way where you could have done something differently and gotten a different outcome, short of eloping before you ever asked anyone to be in the wedding. I also don’t think you’re an asshole for caring about your wedding- wanting a happy wedding day doesn’t mean you don’t care about your sister. I feel like if that were the case, you wouldn’t be giving any of this a second thought or trying to consider how best to include and accommodate her all at once.",kl5el7,gh7e36f,2020-12-27 18:17:00

However, you told her you didn't want her in your wedding right on the back of her confession that she was unhappy with her weight gain. Think for a second how that actually sounded to her.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"NAH. I know this isn't the trend on this thread today but honestly I can see where you're coming from. I don't have an ED (dodged that bullet, I did have some unhealthy food ideas when younger) but a good friend did and I can see how you were trying to protect your sister. 


I can imagine how many potential triggers a day like a wedding could create- it's all about looking nice, it's all about the bridesmaids matching and her having a little extra weight may trigger her, and then she'll feel guilty for ruining the day, then she will spiral and get sick and you'll feel guilty and she will feel guilty for making you feel guilty... 

Honestly I think you had the right idea. However, I think you need to reframe it for your sister. Explain these fears to her, say you're terrified because you don't want her to suffer, ask her what support she needs and ask her to keep an open dialogue with you about her feelings... Then maybe ask her to be a bridesmaid but in a less vital capacity, just so she doesn't feel as much pressure but can still be there on the day if she is well in herself to attend. I think that you do care, OP. And I also think you're also allowed to worry about how this may also affect your already stressful big day.",kl5el7,gh7dpkg,2020-12-27 18:13:43

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"NAH. I am so sorry that your sister is struggling with an eating disorder, and I hope she eventually does recover permanently. Watching this can’t have been easy on any of her loved ones, either, and I sympathise with the rest of you. Tbh I think you made a mistake asking her in the first place when it was an invite contingent on her mental health—even if she was further along in her recovery, considering her history of feeling in competition with her differently shaped sisters, a lot of traditional bridal party activities would probably have been unpleasant for her. 

I also really hope you didn’t mention her weight gain to her. As a red flag of a possible relapse, it’s perfectly valid to note it, but absolutely terrible to mention to someone with an ED as it’s very possible she’ll view it as “I gained weight so now I can’t be in the wedding. Maybe if I lose weight I can get back in.” 

Planning a wedding, especially now, can be stressful, and I don’t blame you for wanting bridesmaids who will most likely be able to be there on the day. The thing is, though, life is unpredictable and we could have another pandemic or one of your bridesmaids could get into a car accident or have food poisoning and still not be able to be there. I’m surprised you weren’t willing to wait and see how your sister was doing before removing her from the wedding—especially doing so during the holidays—but I’m not sure doing so makes you an AH.",kl5el7,gh7929u,2020-12-27 17:32:43

I think other commenters are being too harsh on OP and forget that others are negatively affected by mental health. You want your sister to be herself and not triggered into relapse. Thats the way I read it. Dress fittings can be triggering. Weddings can be triggering. If this is a pattern, you have seen it. Its also difficult to be the relative of someone who is coping with this. People forget that too. Imagine your sister has an addiction. Youve seen it before, the cycle of relapse. Theres AA for the addict and Al-Anon for the family. Its hard on you too. Its not a bad thing to take care of yourself. Thats why theres support groups for family members of those with these kinds of issues. Yes, her feelings are hurt, but shes not starving herself and passing out on your wedding day (hopefully). Now she can focus on breaking the cycle and not on her sister's wedding and the bride can have 1 day that isnt focused on someone else or feel bad for possibly triggering her sister.

What if she relapses and come the wedding the dress doesn’t fit? (Bigger or smaller) further relapse

You kicked her out of your wedding party because of her mental illness, which you then proceeded to minimize by talking about your *own* mental illness. 

What you did is like your sister kicking you out of her wedding party due to your BPD/anxiety. Jesus Christ. “Hey, listen OP.. I have an unfounded feeling my wedding, that you agreed to be in and were looking forward to, might trigger your anxiety and just ruin the *whole* thing, so would you mind, like, not being in it? That way I won’t even care if you’re there or not. I’m just looking out for you.”

You noticed she gained weight and asked how she was doing, not because you care, but so you could decide whether or not you should break the news she’s no longer in your wedding. She confided in you that she was struggling and your immediate concern was how that could affect you. 

Also, talking about how much her ED affected you growing up?? What?? 🤯

“God forbid one single day doesn’t revolve around her I guess”

Again, what?! Anything other than forcing her to “step down” would be making the whole thing revolve around her?? Listen to yourself. I’m usually very much “my wedding, my rules” but what a terribly, terribly selfish sister. What a self obsessed asshole in general.

I read that as Julia getting to be free of planning on being on display/ in a specific dress that day, free of that anxiety, so that her mental health and physical health wasn't put at risk. 

If she's not a bridesmaid, there's no need to pick a dress ahead of time that has to still fit on the day, she can pick a dress that fits right before. Basically the bridesmaid role/ dress could cause anxiety for Julia that would lead to a bad health outcome (and disrupting OP's wedding day).

YTA OP, and also the fact that you had to remind us in your post that ""the rest of us are pretty petite"" (don't worry we saw it the first time) says a lot about how much importance you put on your sizes, and THEN to say 20 pounds is a ""LOT"" all caps of weight.

&#x200B;

I agree that OP didn't handle it as well as she could have, but compassion fatigue is a thing, and it sounds like maybe OP is suffering from it, as well as she later said, she struggles with mental illness herself.   Bridesmaids dresses are typically purchased months in advance, and I could definitely see something like that sending her sister into a tailspin if she was afraid it wasn't going to fit for the wedding.  

&#x200B;

I may have phrased it more as ""Hey, I'm concerned about you given your struggle that having a specific dress and dress fittings coming up may be triggering for you.  I would really like you to participate, but I want you to know that your mental health is more important, and I hope you can talk to your therapist about strategies to cope with this.  I don't care what dress size you end up being on the wedding day, only that you are healthy and able to be with us, but please let me know if you can participate by \*date\* so I can make appropriate arrangements. ""  

I do find it a little weird that OPs sister is the only one to have struggled with her weight and I wonder if there might not be some sort of underlying medical issue.  Weight issues do tend to run in families even if they aren't genetic (just lifestyle and eating habits that are learned from parents) and I find it a little odd that only one sibling didn't get healthy eating habits from their parents.  Maybe it's just most of the people with siblings that I know, but they all tend to be in the same BMI range, at least until some major life changes like a knee injury or food intolerance or kids or whatever.",kl5el7,gh7pyua,2020-12-27 19:58:04

You very well may have harmed your sister even further into releapse because of one day.

Eta I've read your updates and something else stood out at me.  Your sister was vunerable.and told you she was struggling. The very next thing you do is uninvite her from the bridal party.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"Tbh as someone with an ED myself, I'm surprised that I had to scroll so far down for a comment that wasn't Y T A. I don't think OP is TA, and I agree with what you're saying. Having an ED is tough on everyone who cares about you and I think OP is trying her best in a difficult situation. It is hard to admit to a relapse so it's likely the sister would not have admitted to it, especially with the added pressure of not wanting to ruin OPs wedding by dropping out or something. 

Of course, if I was in that position, I would be hurt as my first reaction, but ultimately would realise that it's probably for the best. Sure, maybe OP could've handled it more tactfully but, idk it's an uncomfortable situation at best. 

OP, I would suggest that you try to have another sit down with your sister and tell her that you, by no means, meant to dictate what she can and cannot do, that you would love to have her in your bridal party, but you really really want her to consider what would be best for her mental health first and foremost. Then detail exactly what you are expecting from her as a bridesmaid vs her as a guest, and let her decide whether she is capable or not.

I also really don't blame OP for wanting to have her wedding as stress free as possible. They have spent a lot of time, effort, and money planning a wedding and they should have a lovely happy day to celebrate OP and her hubby-to-be. This would be so much more difficult if OPs sister is suffering a relapse, and they KNOW it's because she's in the wedding party due to some sense of familial obligation. 

Also, tbh, I know that a lot of people see it as OP dictating what sister should do, but sometimes, removing the choice from someone is the best option. I know it is for me sometimes. If OP does ask sister, ofc sister wants to be included, will she choose it over the risk to her mental health? Possibly! If OP knows this about sister, maybe its better to be the AH for a little while and spare sister from a choice that may make her mental health worse, or conversely that may make her feel guilty. 

Shitty situation all around, NAH.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"Repeating a comment that I made to someone else: I have to agree with you here. This is not exactly about weight, but a about how a mental illness, psychological disorder or addiction can affect an entire family dynamic. I think that people sometimes don't understand the feelings of neglect or exhaustion the ""well"" siblings can experience when everything ends up revolving around another sibling's illness. There are many studies about what happens when one child has a disability and other children feel like all of the attention goes to that child and that the well children's lives are a secondary thought. These ideas get hard-wired in a child's mind and may carry into adulthood. I think people are being too hard on the OP.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"I mean, that's actually the part that broke my heart for both sisters because it's clear this whole family needs to be in therapy. Julia's been struggling with this her whole life, and when one sibling is struggling that badly, everyone goes along for the ride (I know this from experience). OP mentioned family holidays have been redirected to focus all on Julia after she's had an ED related meltdown and that Julia has been in and out of treatment for a long time. A lot of OP's life and her understanding of her family dynamic has revolved around Julia's eating disorder. That's not a healthy emotional environment for anyone to grow up in. I feel for Julia, I've been in her shoes and fought hard to not end up back in her shoes, but I've also been the sibling who got swept up in another siblings life long problems growing up. I can understand why OP is so defensive of this one day. On the one hand, she's a caring sister (since I'm choosing to believe she really is concerned about her sister), and it's perfectly realistic to think that a role that requires dress fittings and maintaining a certain weight for months in order to fit a dress could ruin her sister's mental health. On the other hand, she's clearly a resentful sister,and yes, she voiced that in an incredibly blunt way, but I don't think that makes her horrible.

Oh you breaking out so bad? That’s because you’re eating all that greasy food. You know it couldn’t be because i was going through puberty.

Forced into track and sports so I could “workout” parents only praised or talked about what I was doing if it was fitness related. 

4mo in college I went on a all liquid diet and for about 3 mo after that I was terrified of food. If I ate food I was going to get fat again and then I’d have to hear comments from my parents 

This is probably what’s happening to Op’s sister. You think anytime she comes around the family she wants to hear about her body?! She wants to talk about where’s she is in recovery etc 

No. 

Being the “ugly duckling” of a family even if they weren’t flat out mean to her still has sideffects on her self esteem.

There is going to be a selfish slant to not wanting her sister to potentially relapse and mean last minute change of plans/ a distraction to the wedding. However, she probably has had many events overshadowed by attention being on her sister receiving care or walking on eggshells to prevent a relapse.

My sister was pregnant during my wedding and had the same worries so this is what I did for her and it worked great. 

It seems more important to OP that her bridal party looks perfect than her sister being a part of her wedding. 

Instead of automatically suggesting the sister step down from being a bridesmaid,  she should have just had a conversation with her and asked her what would make her feel most comfortable.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"come on dude. this sounds like at least **1.5 decades** of an eating disorder, which required freaking *rehab*. 

I have a dad who's an alcoholic, not an abusive one or anything but it still affects me. it has affected my thinking of what a future partner should be like, scared of being an addict in the future myself but in this context, the upheaval of someone struggling with health issues in the same house is... something else together. you get nervous, anxious for your family member's wellbeing. you get scared that they're going to die relatively quicker because of their habits e.g. for my case my dad smokes and drinks (so you know what I'm talking about) 

all I'm saying is it's so redundant to just reduce the issue into ""boohoo, op doesn't want to have a fat sister as a bridesmaid"".

OP would be the asshole if she didn't invite purely because her sister was overweight and might ruin the aesthetic or something.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"I think I'm actually leaning NAH. My first thought was to call OP an asshole but with her edits, I feel for OP.  I've never been in OP's shoes but I have worked with special needs kids though, and I think sometimes people forget how much that impacts siblings. And I think it's okay for the sibling to want one day in their life (or even just in the year, like their birthday) that feels normal and happy to them and isn't about doing everything to make sure special sibling is okay. 

OP mentions meltdowns ""ruining"" multiple holidays (from OP's pov, at least?) and ""something as simple as someone gifting her an item of clothing caused her to break down in front of everyone."" If that is what Julia is like when she is struggling with her ED, is it a good idea to have her get fitted for matching dresses with all her slender sisters? Ect.

> And yes, of course protecting my wedding day is part of my consideration here. God forbid one single day doesn’t revolve around her I guess.  

I admit that is a selfish somewhat harsh thing to say. But I also hope we can empathize that OP says that her sister's ED has negatively impacted her life for years. That she has had many family gatherings walking on eggshells and not feeling happy as a result. And while I certainly feel bad for Julia to be going through that, I do feel bad for OP too. It must be hard to have every single family event walking on eggshells trying to not do anything that might upset Julia, or with everyone just worrying about Julia ect. And I can understand why OP would not want to spend her wedding day worrying about and catering to Julia's big emotional reactions. 

Also, OP has mental  health issues of her own including anxiety. Which has to make spending her wedding worrying about Julia having a ""meltdown"" (OP's words, not sure what she's done in the past that counts as this) harder? 

I feel this is sort of a no win situation here. I agree the kindest thing for OP to do would be to keep Julia in her wedding and then carefully tip-toe and cater all the wedding party situations to not trigger Julia. But her triggers are clothing and food, and it's a wedding, and I can understand that OP just dosen't want to have to deal with that. It sounds like having Julia in her wedding will genuinely make it less of a good experience for OP who is going to be anxious and walking on eggshells and also worries that the family as a whole will be focusing on Julia's feelings. So we're expecting OP to be kind to Julia at her own expense (having a more stressful less happy wedding) when it sounds like she feels she's already been putting Julia's emotional issues first at most of her other family events for much of her life.",kl5el7,gh86gj6,2020-12-27 22:16:15

Tbh considering the sister’s history, she really shouldn’t have asked her to be a bridesmaid at all.

She saw the warning signs and made an adjustment based on how she thought her sister would react during future fittings. It’s either address the situation before it gets out of control, or let it play out and add major stress to her wedding (which she explained would happen based on prior experience with her sister’s eating disorder).

This is not exactly about weight, but a about how a mental illness, psychological disorder or addiction can affect an entire family dynamic. I think that people sometimes don't understand the feelings of neglect or exhaustion the ""well"" siblings can experience when everything ends up revolving around another sibling's illness. There are many studies about what happens when one child has a disability and other children feel like all of the attention goes to that child and that the well children's lives are a secondary thought.

And since I need to get my weight under control (also just diagnosed as clinically obese now instead of just overweight) I was told to try and stick to eating around 1200 calories to be in a deficit since I dont exercise (though I was encouraged to start light exercise)

Now that I'm actually calorie counting and have cut out all my sugar snacks I've been averaging about 900 calories a day and only eating twice a day...I've already lost weight because I'm essentially starving myself but because I've been happy with how I look in the mirror I havent been able to bring myself to eat more now.

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,I feel like the correct answer here is to discuss the concerns and ask the sister if she can handle it given the current situation. Her ED is already creeping back in with the lockdown due to unforeseen circumstances. Throw in fittings with constant measuring and being beside slender women. On top of that the bridesmaid dresses have to look good on everyone. With it likely heavily skewing to what looks good on a slim frame.  Meaning the final dress might make the sister feel ugly because it's not precisely picked out for her specifically. This could easily tip the scales. I'd ask her and let her chose. If she tries to continue on being MOH but finds it difficult she can step down at any time with sufficient notice and have a co-MOH working with her sister in case of a staff change so she picks up right where OPs sister drops off if things get serious.,kl5el7,gh84de0,2020-12-27 21:58:07

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"""I wanted to ask you to be my bridesmaid but I know I can't understand your struggles. Would you be ok with this or do you think it might be triggering, etc?""

But guess what, sister may have blown off her own disorder and been like ""Oh sure! It's fine"" bc denying there's a problem is a staple of chronic relapsers. You do everything you can to cater to them and they suck the life out of you. It's sad bc you know they're victims too.

The girl keeps relapsing. It's chronic. There's nothing OP could have done. At a certain point you need to look out for yourself when someone's chronic relapsing keeps impacting you. Be there to support but it's neither reasonable nor fair for OP to have to play games over whether she's even capable of dealing with fittings and being a bridesmaid now that she's relapsing again.

The only real solution would have been eschewing the idiotic need to have everyone in matching outfits that comes with weddings. 

My feelings on the stupidity of wedding traditions aside, I don't hold that against OP. She wanted a wedding like 99% of people have.",kl5el7,gh7t1ou,2020-12-27 20:24:20
AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"I totally agree. I personally got the sense that OP was trying to both protect her sister AND her wedding day, but went about the conversation in the wrong way. OP, if you’re still reading replies, ASK your sister what she thinks she’ll be capable of doing and what she’s comfortable with. Make sure you tell her that you don’t care about her weight - you were worried for her being put into these circumstances if she was on the verge of a relapse. Apologize for not making that clear, and for taking her agency away here. 

For the record, I don’t think you’re some sort of monster. I think you’re in a difficult situation, and you’re trying to balance a lot of things. I hope all of this works out for you and your family.

The funny thing is, there are way too many people who don’t understand that it’s a serious medical emergency, since they know someone who has a dairy sensitivity or lactose intolerance and claims to have a dairy allergy to quickly explain to people that they can’t have dairy. Instead of making more people aware of the severity of the condition, it actually lessens people’s understanding making them think it’s not a big deal when the person claiming the allergy only gets gas or something non-life-threatening. My wife used to be a barista and a coworker claimed that she could have milk if she scalds it first because someone she knows does that for their “allergy”. Also, people with lactose intolerance don’t react to everything dairy, like butter. Butter can potentially kill my wife. There are also the people who seem to think that it’s some sort of liberal political stance or because of a fad diet that, instead of respecting it, will do something like put in skim milk into a latte instead of the soy milk my wife asked for, which resulted in her getting poisoned last week.

Good for you. It’s hard for people to understand eating disorders. Two of my family members have them. Regardless of an eating disorder, you should never comment on what another person is eating.

On average, a person diagnosed with anorexia will live 25 years less than average — that statistic includes those who make a full recovery. Even a few years of active anorexia does permanent, irreparable damage to a person's body. Osteopenia/Osteoporosis are extremely common. Treatment is hard to find, very expensive, and there are no medications and few specific therapies to treat Anorexia. If anyone wants sources for my stats I can dig them up.

Having struggled with Anorexia for a decade as well as being severely underweight as a child due to neglect, it feels very eerie knowing that the damage done to my body is—with current medical advances—irreversible and it is unlikely that I will live a long life.

I haven't thrown up from my eating disorder in a year!,"On the other side of this it's definitely worth it.  What eventually got me through the horror of recovery is when I realized I would either die from it or recover so late in life I would stay fat forever (I know this is fucked up thinking, because being ""fat"" isn't actually bad.)  

I did gain weight for the first year (of course I had to), but in years two and three in recovery it tapered back down without altering my diet or working out, it just naturally came back down to about where I was pre-ed.  I still don't work out (although I am fairly active), and I enjoy french fries and ice cream on a weekly basis (personal fear foods).  

I was deep into my disorder for the better part of seven years, which is partially why I overshot so much and then slowly tapered down, the earlier you begin recovery the faster it will go.  I was in my late 20's when I began to recover, and I overshot horrendously which was terrifying at first, but eventually I got over it, fell in love with my body and then a wonderful man who was supportive and would never let me skip a meal given my history.  Suddenly this year I went to the doctor and realized it had all come back off without my paying attention.  

Please, keep up the good recovery work.  You'll get there, and it's so worth it.  


edit: For everyone like OMGFAT, I'm saying being overweight isn't necessarily bad.  Being morbidly obese / unable to complete certain tasks important to living is definitely a problem, but what our society considers ""fat"" is actually pretty average.  Also for everyone suggesting I'm a gigantor because I'm saying this, my BMI is 21/22 (up two points from my pre-ed weight + the difference between 20 years old and 30)

edit 2: Put ""fat"" in brackets to further clarify.  What I considered fat during my eating disorder is far from morbid obesity, people with eating disorders have skewed perceptions about what will make them be considered fat vs what the rest of the world considers fat.

"If you have a history with eating disorders, know this about ""I'm Glad My Mom Died""","As a mental health provider I would like to add that a serious eating disorder like anorexia nervosa (AN) isn’s about weight. It is rooted in severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. It’s also not just being focused on weight, as weight loss is both a symptom and modus operandi of AN. The most severe type of AN is notable for its chronicity and can be regarded in acute episodes as slow form of suicide. There are patients whose AN is a lifelong illness where it re-emerges throughout different times in their lives. It is NOT about weight and appearance, those are just outward manifestations of depression, anxiety, OCD. AN has the highest mortality rate of all mental health conditions. 

I often see eating disorders be trivialized on social media and public forums, particularly those who label anything and everything as eating disorders. Telling someone with severe AN that they look thin enough or to gain weight, that will not fix their deep rooted problems. Comparing dieting attempts with those having serious eating disorder is not helpful. 

So please, try not to make discussions of AN that’s centered on weight/ weight obsession and looks as those things are NOT why those with severe AN are difficult to treat.",yls59n,iv1vjgd,2022-11-04 17:31:07

"If you have a history with eating disorders, know this about ""I'm Glad My Mom Died""","Pro-ana tumblr, Twitter, and TikTok are alive and well, so putting a CW for “in-depth and explicit discussion of active eating disorder behaviors” wouldn’t bring a significant amount of people in to purposely trigger themselves when they have whole communities of other people who want to trigger themselves to interact with. It would, however, significantly decrease the amount of people unintentionally triggered. 

I knew going in there was mention of EDs. I’ve read memoirs and novels with ED mentions in them before and been fine. I had no idea how in-depth Jeanette went here with her thought process and restriction, and verbalizing her thoughts of how she was eating too much and was too heavy at just 95 pounds. 

Those thoughts are exactly the same thoughts I had when I was actively restricting, but haven’t had them for over 6 years. This book brought them back into the front of my mind. I’m constantly checking calories on boxes again, my mind wants me to stop eating before I’m full because I’ve already eaten too much. I put the book down at 40% months ago and I’m still trying to rid the thoughts again. 

To me, it’s like an alcoholic drinking a mocktail at a bar after recovery. A mildly dangerous place to be, with a mildly dangerous drink from a bartender you don’t know. Then, you find out they actually put something in there that was .5% alcohol. Small enough to legally be considered non-alcoholic, but enough for you to be in a more dangerous place again. If you were told that the mocktail was actually .5% alcoholic, you would’ve likely avoided it to be safe. Sure, perhaps some people who aren’t truly recovered would jump at the chance to consume some amount of alcohol. But they’re already at a bar- they’ve got the world to choose from, why would they choose this tiny .5% ABV drink? To me, that’s what TW/CW do. 

Side note, I do prefer the term Content Warning over Trigger Warning, as “trigger” can be a buzzword to certain groups, and it more handily allows authors to simply give warnings for content that some people may want to avoid but won’t trigger them, such as gratuitous gore or on-page sexual assault (read by someone who’s not experienced it).

That isn't because I'm weak, it's because I know myself and am brave enough to do so. It may be helpful to learn more about how complex eating disorders are before speaking on them.

"If you have a history with eating disorders, know this about ""I'm Glad My Mom Died""","(disclaimer: i’ve been in recovery for several years, i’m fine currently, and i’m speaking from experience being very online for many years in eating disorder communities)

having an eating disorder isn’t /really/ about a desire to lose weight to be beautiful - it might start that way (tho not always)… but really it’s about inflicting suffering on yourself. 

as my anorexia got worse i didn’t want to look like a supermodel. i wanted to look like a skeleton. i wanted to frighten people. the more grotesque i looked the better. i got a thrill out of hurting myself. i started wanting to destroy my body; i felt like it had betrayed me. i wanted to be a ghost. i loved the idea that people would look at me and worry for my health. you know you should stop because you’re hurting yourself but at a certain point that just… becomes the point. ed communities are full of imagery of glamorous thin celebrities but also the most harrowing fucked up images you can imagine because we’re all deeply depressed and self loathing. 

it’s also straight up addictive, and because of that, things that remind you of your ed will trigger a relapse. just one more fast day… just one more binge… then i’ll stop this time, really! and triggers around it are difficult to escape. food is inescapable, everyone displays calorie counts for every fucking thing everywhere now and diet culture is ubiquitous. i cannot “diet” - it WILL become anorexia again. i had to work really really hard to learn to ignore calories and not be sent into a spiral of self destructive behavior over glancing at a nutrition label. 

eating disorders are also wildly competitive. ed communities are full of people intentionally triggering themselves and others. my life was swallowed by those communities because comparing myself to others motivated me to do “better”. a strategy that worked was to pick a buddy and essentially compete against each other. some of the people i followed i did so because i was doing “better” than them and felt smug about it. when i watched movies and read books about it i’d be thinking “lol i’ve done worse” and then proceed to get worse.

so graphic depictions of how bad it is for you and how dangerous it is are like… yeah, that’s the point. the suffering is a feature not a bug.",yls59n,iv16qcp,2022-11-04 14:49:33
"If you have a history with eating disorders, know this about ""I'm Glad My Mom Died""","In addition to Trintron’s comment, I think people who haven’t experienced an ED have a hard time understanding that it is incredibly similar to a substance addiction in terms of thoughts and behavior patterns. For me, engaging with ED media feels very similar to what I imagine it’s like for, say, a recovered alcoholic to watch a movie with binge drinking. While we’re aware of the grisly, nasty parts (and that awareness may help prevent a true relapse), it still puts us in that rose-tinted addiction headspace.",yls59n,iv132zr,2022-11-04 14:24:40
"If you have a history with eating disorders, know this about ""I'm Glad My Mom Died""","I think it's a bit of an out of side out of mind protective factor, for people who are at a place where they shouldn't engage with content with graphic descriptions of EDs. If they don't engage with the media, their coping skills can keep the thoughts at bay. 

If you aren't having those kinds of thoughts and you encounter someone else's thoughts along those damaging lines in a really personal way, it could trigger the onset of those thoughts for you again because now those ideas and feelings are kicking around in your head. 

When I had panic disorder I found it hard to hear other people talk about things that triggered my panic because it reminded me of what I got intensely anxious about in my own life. Now that I'm in a much better place, hearing about those same topics doesn't instigate the same response in me. 

So if you're newly recovered or still somewhat raw while in recovery, you might not want a reminder to kick start the mental processes. I don't think it's necessarily ED specific but more about how our brains are habituated to certain thought paths, and if you're trying to stop those neural pathways for some people avoiding them all together is key. 

Recovery looks different for different people tho. Others might find seeing someone else's pain in the same vein as their pain beneficial in that they'll feel less alone and weird, for example. Seeing your experiences in another person might be healing for some people depending on what their own experiences and relationships with their mental health are like. There's very few universal truths for how to approach mental illness and recovery.",yls59n,iv0zyms,2022-11-04 14:02:42
"If you have a history with eating disorders, know this about ""I'm Glad My Mom Died""","It might help you to imagine it for another addictive behavior, like let's say alcoholism. If you have been in recovery, you might have developed a lot of self-regulation and self-awareness tools to help you recognize and stop your own thought patterns from leading you all the way back into the active addiction mental space.

Then one day you're completely immersed in a piece of writing, being carried along with it, and at some point you start reading detailed descriptions of the behaviors, feelings, and sensory experiences around being a person who is physically drinking and getting problematically drunk. The smells, the actions, the physical sensations of consuming the alcohol and starting to feel intoxication in your body. The incredibly familiar thought patterns. You have already been empathizing with this character, and you still are, and this character is engaging in your addiction.

You have now basically been piggybacked into someone else's mental space that is shaped very similarly to your own active addiction mental space, and now you're completely feeling it and thinking about it, and you might end up engaging with the behaviors while you're thinking and feeling these things. Because your own recognizable patterns aren't what brought you here, you didn't get a chance to catch yourself and go in a different direction before you were fully in it.",yls59n,iv168mq,2022-11-04 14:46:13

As for your second point, I agree with you. I know it's not considered best practice in therapy to 100% avoid triggers(because it can make anxiety and PTSD conditions worse, due to reinforcing the mental pathways of avoidance -> relief), but the problem is that safe exposure needs to happen as part of a treatment plan under the guidance of a professional...*not* randomly in your life when you don't have tools or the support structure to handle it.

It was unlocked because the title screen looped with this as his active window. There was shitty music. I closed it and locked it because the office is shared and our kid - then 5 - was awake. It’s been years and my guy was actually sorry. He got mad when I u healthily dropped the weight although I had a very scary health situation where weight loss improved my survival chance. So I went balls to the wall with it. I lost the weight and kept it off, but I was actively dying. I’m keeping it off, because going through that health scare again isn’t any less potentially lethal.

Definitely go to HR. Making comments about what you’re eating and about your body is inappropriate and unprofessional even more so that you have asked them to stop and they have continued. Your manager isn’t bothered as long as your work is done and you tidy after yourself so they shouldn’t be either.

I remember working in an office and I happily put my headphones on so I wouldn’t have to hear diet talk. Anytime someone brought sweets in they would ask out loud if they should have some or not and they were always told to go on then. Who is going to actually say no to them without it hurting their feelings or being seen as rude? 

NTA whatsoever.

I have ADHD. Healthy meal prep is hard and most of the time my breakfast was a packet of Belvita or something I grabbed that was just enough for me to take my meds. 

So, yeah, a lot of my calories where at lunch. I also didn't drink the super sugary Starbucks drinks they did. If you added those to their lunch meal, even my heaviest lunches were probably less calories and *more nutritious* because it was food, not sugar. 

But apparently my Diet Cokes were bad. I'm not a coffee person, so that's my caffeine. Yeah, artifical sugar isn't the best, but I don't see how a heavy cream and sugar coffee is any better. We didn't have a kettle or a good way to make tea, so keeping cokes in the fridge was easier once my morning tea ran out. 

Like *why* do people care about a stranger's food habits? Unless you suspect someone has an ED, there is no reason to even pay attention. You aren't their doctor, ffs. 

Notably, none of the detectives (it was a local pd) said a word. The department was super big into health, so most ate healthy overall, but no one gave a fuck what anyone else was eating. The most they would say is recommend local places for good food that you could quickly grab. 

I stopped eating with the other interns. The detectives knew why and would invite me to eat with them if I was the only intern in the office or the other interns weren't the toxic ones.

Edit: more ideas are welcome if anyone sees this comment. 

To hop on OP’s ideas- stress management and emotional regulation is so so important for losing weight while dealing with binge eating tendencies. Food is often a distraction from the emotions you’re trying to avoid, not feel, suppress etc. The taste, smell, texture, sight of the food distract your senses. When you’re replacing what you binge eat on.. it helps to try to make these healthy replacements as palatable as you can. I make good crunchy salad with different dressings and loads of colourful veggies. I cut up 3-4 different fruits and make a beautiful fruit bowl. I allow myself some honey, syrup with granola to indulge my senses. Coffee/decafe- smell and taste is already quite engaging for your sensory systems. With fox nuts and pop corn- you have the crunchiness to focus on. So yeah.. these are the intricacies of food, binge eating, and emotional coping.

"If you're a binge eater, continue binge eating instead of restricting. Game the system.","I have realized that this is why I and lots of others feel frustrated and unsatisfied while changing our lifestyle and losing weight. You wonder how skinny people can eat so little and be satiated and why you have to eat so much. Well it's because you are looking for that FULL feeling. You are looking to feel full and cnmpletely satiated, not just until your hunger is gone. You are chasing that content, calm feeling after a meal, but that's not what thin people or even just normal weight people do. They don't want to be in a food coma after every meal like overeaters do. They eat until their hunger is gone and no more. They only eat until they are full on special occasions like birthdays, christmas dinner, maybe the occasional fast food meal once every couple of months.

 The problem with us is that we have used food for pleasure as if it's a special occassion every day for such a long time that we don't realize that the feeling we are looking for when eating is not what we are supposed to be looking for. I don'tbelieve it is that your brain is not telling you when to stop eating. You're just not looking for those signs. You are looking for something else... which is too much pleasure. Thin people dont care about food as much as we do because they never developed this drug addiction-like habit. They dont eat to feel high. A meal is not a whole event for them. It's just someting functional they have to do to keep themselves alive. I only realized this recently and most people who have an overeating problem never realize this which is why they are constantly relapsing and falling back into bad habits. They dont understand what needs changing. They just constanly keep dieting while never feeling satisfied with their meals and always thinking about food and constantly having to dodge palatable food. Normal people dont spend their time thinking this much about food, they get pleasure elsewhere.",u99469,i5quzvl,2022-04-22 13:22:15
"If you're a binge eater, continue binge eating instead of restricting. Game the system.","One of my favorite things is to make myself slow WAY down when eating. If its a fork and knife meal,put my utensils down between each bite. If it's a pizza, don't pick up slice number two immediately after slice one - wait a minute or two, talk to a friend, read a reddit post, whatever. Something in a bowl - fill the bowl less, with the rest to the side for seconds/thirds. I usually won't get up to get the second portion immediately, so now there is a forced wait time until I can take another bite.

I've found even I do that, I end up feeling full sooner. I assume my stomach just has more time to actually process how full it is, and to tell my head. I think another popular tip is to drink water during your meal to fill up - so like, one slice of pizza, drink a third of your glass before picking up the next slice. Forces you to slow down, and maybe also fills you up.

Now it's not like doing that made me eat like, 50% less or something drastic, but every little bit counts, and even one less scoop of spaghetti while still feeling satisfied is a win for me.",u99469,i5rxnm2,2022-04-22 17:40:29

"If you're a binge eater, continue binge eating instead of restricting. Game the system.","I have a couple phrases/ideas I keep in mind that have helped me be okay with calorie restriction: 

Everything in moderation, including moderation. When I decide I want to indulge, I have to let myself be okay with that decision and indulge guilt-free. If you do it while thinking the whole time that you shouldn't, you still feel like you're restricting, but seasoned with guilt and shame.

I don't have to be perfect, just better. I don't like a lot of the foods that get pushed as healthy recipes. I don't want granola and yogurt or a banana for breakfast, and I don't want fish for dinner. But if I get a bacon egg and cheese on a roll instead of a sausage egg and cheese on a bagel, that's an improvement. If I drink water between most bites and feel full without going for seconds, that's an improvement. 

I lost 40 lbs and gained back half of it during the pandemic, so I have varying degrees of success with calorie restriction because of all the other factors in life. But I learned that it never worked for me when it came from a place of self-hatred. It only works for me coming from a place of self-love, wanting to treat my body well, wanting to surprise myself with what I'm capable of achieving, and trying to appreciate that food has an undeniable social and emotional importance but also acts as fuel for my body and I only need so much fuel at a time.",u99469,i5qohak,2022-04-22 12:28:41
"If you're a binge eater, continue binge eating instead of restricting. Game the system.","Here's what helped me the most:

Every day is just a day.

That's it. That's the motto that I've come up with through tons of therapy. You binge with high calorie stuff today? So what. It's just food. And today is just a day. Today will not destroy you. Why feel guilty? There's no need. Tomorrow is another day.

Some days are ""better"" and some days are ""worse,"" but as long as you're making healthier choices in the net, it doesn't matter.

And if you can, stop viewing some foods as good and some foods as bad. Instead, view some foods as nutritious and others as not. It's so hard to separate emotions from the eating, but if you start working on it, you stop hyperfocusing on food as much.",u99469,i5rx7a4,2022-04-22 17:37:31

Buffalo, and other similar hot sauces, salsa, sriracha, things of this nature, are made from chilis (a veggie), usually vinegar + water base, and seasonings. A lot of hot sauces are like 5 calories a tablespoon. So you can slather veggies with 6 tablespoons of hot sauce for 30 calories.  

Soy sauce is only 10 cals a tablespoon, but it does contain a lot of sodium. They do have low sodium options because of this. Soy sauce and terriyaki sauce can jazz up veggies really quickly! Terriyaki is only around 15 cals a tablespoon (if you get terriyaki marinade and not a sweet terriyaki sauce like from waba grill)  

BBQ sauces and some others things in this genre are usually a little higher because they may have oils in them and are usually more like 30 calories a tablespoon.  

Watch out for anything cream or oil based, like ranch, caesar, creamy cilantro, etc, anything creamy. Like a good buttermilk ranch can be up to 120 calories per 1 tablespoon. You can see how quickly that can add up.  

There are lots of low calorie dressings that are pretty good, lots of different brands are making other options to the full fat dressings. Many other sauces have low sodium options or low fat or whatever is your pleasure. You can make a good replacement ranch using greek yogurt plus a hidden valley ranch powder packet, thinned down with water.

I can’t stop f****** binge eating,"When you eat, it takes a lot of energy for your stomach to digest the food. Your body has a limited amount of energy and when it comes to digesting, your body puts all its energy into this action, which means that your brain is put on hold for a while and you will think less, because your body is giving energy to another place. So if you have too much activity in your brain, digestion 'helps' to calm your brain.

It's the same for most people who stay at home on Sundays doing nothing, your body wants to move, to be active, and you have to repress this need for activity because you want to relax at home, so you eat more, to put all your organs to rest while your stomach works. And it works! But it's rubbish.

Maybe realising this will help you redirect your actions to solve the 'real problem'. But the aim would be to really calm the mind with meditation or breathing exercises, to regulate thinking, and not find another compulsive solution like eating.

Not easy, but let’s start with understanding our behaviour first and have compassion for the unconscious bad solutions we find to make ourselves feel better. Cause that’s all we’re trying to do : feel better. But let’s also leave the door open for other better solutions.",1apibd3,kq7f7d2,2024-02-13 07:51:56

Has anyone actually beaten binge eating?,"I feel like it took me years. First stopping most of the behaviour, mostly with help of outside accountability. Then another round of finding deeper understanding.   
  
looking back, I think these were the milestones… (btw. thank you for the opportunity to write this reflection :))

\- later years of highschool: occasional binge and purge. College years: overweight but relatively good body image, living a generally happy and care- free life. Occasionally eating a complete chocolate bar or sleeve of Oreo’s all at one, but not purging. 

\- 2014-17 Learning more about CICO. Lose 25 kg within a year. Maintained that until 2021. Feel much better physically but also start to develop restrictive thoughts and put very high standards on myself. Have periods where I would meet the criteria for Orthorexia and BED. In first six months of 2017 it got to the point of multiple binge/purges throughout the month, and every night in the days before my menstruation)

\- 2017 opening up to my partner (then boyfriend now husband). He thought I was cheating because he coul reach me on the nights I was all miserable binge-eating and being miserable about the binge. On those nights I was so embarrassed that I just cut contact with the outside world. (We didn’t live together back then)

\- 2017-18 seeking help from a specialist therapist. She helped me define what the stress-causing situations were for me. This helped in finding some patterns, but we didn’t really get to the real underlying problems. My behaviour MOSTLY stopped, but the urge was very often still there.

\- 2018 - 2022 moving in with my partner who is a natural intuitive eater (yes, they exist) made sure that I could mirror his behaviour a bit. Most of the binging stopped.  
The ”restrictive” and “rebellious“ thoughts didn’t stop, though. Especially in times of stress. On nights when my partner was way I would (a) binge or (b) make sure that I met up with friends to prevent a binge. On nights I was really stressed but my partner was at home I would have “mini-binges”: not an overly excessive amount, yet more than I needed, wanted and also to the point of being uncomfortably full. And of course feeling immense guilt every night.

\- 2022 started talking about that to my partner

\- December 2022 realising that my self-depricating thoughts were not okay. That it took too much of my headspace. 

\- Early 2023 seeking help for the thoughts. Finding, after some time on the waiting list and a therapist that didn’t fit, a good one who was not just looking at my food-thoughts but seeing a much broader pattern in me: always looking to be in control, and blaming myself for not being in control. 

\- 2024 After a year working together she diagnosed me with (mild/high-functioning) OCPD. This clicked, and within four months I can now  be more mild to myself. I now accept that I function easily if I can stick to the plan, and am more aware that not being able to stick to a plan is stressful for me, but that it’s okay to feel stressed in this temporary situation. Having a better, deeper understanding of what’s causing my binge-thoughts has made it so much easier to recognise them and disregard them.",1gnv6m6,lwdrhz2,2024-11-10 07:55:52
Has anyone actually beaten binge eating?,"Yep, I did. Man this sounds nuts but basically one day someone was chatting to me about what I felt both physically and emotionally before, during and after a binge. I had had a gastric sleeve so the physical hunger was gone, and yet… 

Well, a good way into this conversation something seemed to click for her and she told me to look into alcoholism and use Alcoholics Anonymous strategies (but especially the wheel, which identifies what you’re feeling that leads to drinking and the opposite emotion you need to seek to achieve to try and beat the cycle) - and it fricken worked. It worked. 

I still have little relapses, when I forget to ground myself or regulate myself or I’m just too tired to fight it… but food doesn’t dominate my life like it used to. It’s just kind of there, a normal amount. I think about what’s for dinner, and lunch, and I have a birthday later in the week so I’ll have fruit today and cake then.

Binge Eating Tips 101 from a Dietitian Who Used to Binge Eat,"Regarding deprivation: yes, physical deprivation can be a trigger. But the lack of lasting satiety is not a product of deprivation - it's a product of excessive dopamine ""tolerance"". BED is much closer to any other addiction than this post makes it seem; a heroin addict doesn't take heroin because she's been depriving herself of heroin; she takes heroin because she is in an extreme spike-trough dopamine cycle and is desperate for the next spike. 

In other words, it's not that our ""hunger cues are overregulated,"" it's that our dopamine production is underregulated. This is why Vyvanse is a fairly common prescription for BED. It's not a cure and it has side effects, but it helps maintain the dopamine.

All that said, I think your tips are mostly solid advice:

Regular meals absolutely help (though obviously many of us are thrown because modern life makes it difficult to habituate). 

Making foods ""off limits"" will likely make things harder (though I must admit that I have zero off-limits foods, and the result is that I just frequently binge all of them). 

Avoiding the all-or-nothing mindset sounds great, but it's like one or two steps away from saying ""avoid having BED"". 

Eating balanced meals, like regular meals, does make it easier to stave off the binging, but like...if I could convince myself to go with the papaya salad over the green curry with extra rice, I wouldn't have BED in the first place.

I have no idea what a ""fear food"" is, to be honest. Is it like a food you're actually afraid of? Becauss I refuse to eat raw jellyfish. Or is it a food you have a hard time not binging? Because idk about everyone else, but that's all of them for me.

Sorry, I hate to come across as so grouchy. It's a frustrating disorder. I appreciate that you're trying to help and hopefully succeeding with some people.",168flx5,jyxuuj9,2023-09-03 12:41:18

[Conversation] I overcame serious binge eating disorder. Ask me anything.,"Thank you for posting! I suffered from various EDs, and the most challenging thing for me after getting healthy, was trusting my desire to lose a little weight and be more fit. Finding the ways to do this in health and aligned with what my body actually wants (lose a little, be a little more fit, but nothing extreme) has been an on-going, meditative process.

The turning point for me in ED recovery, was the idea that the voice that blamed me for being fat, out of control, worthless, and that I should starve myself, was the same voice that urged me to eat when I wasn't hungry, binge, eat to not feel or to feel better, etc. Connecting those two voices as the same helped me see the larger pattern I was stuck in.

Now I'm pregnant, and I am totally zoned in on what my body wants to eat and do. My experiences with ED and recovery, I think help me in being able to really trust myself :) I am growing a baby, and so my body's health literally creates another life!

No questions for you, just wanted to share my experience.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Lol, yeah, it is 

Before I was diagnosed at 22, I actually had “Binge eating disorder” due to feeling misunderstood and depressed all the time (I was eating to generate dopamine). Once I got my diagnosis and found the right medication, I felt in control of my life for the first time, and the depression mostly went away (along with the eating disorder). I lost 100lbs in a year, and became a much healthier person overall, and have maintained that lifestyle to present day (now in my mid 30s).

… Imagine my surprise when *earlier this year* I’m listening to a podcast about ADHD in the car one day and they start talking about my *exact* eating habits from about 4th grade until after college… I didn’t know I had an eating disorder for most of my life until over a decade after I had overcome it

No one asked, but I want to suggest the intuitive eating book and workbook by Elyse Resch and Evelyn Tribole if you have any guilt about eating or overly focus on food.

It completely changed my relationship with food, dieting, and myself. I don't have food rules but still eat veggies, proteins, fruit, and grains most of the time. If I want chips I eat some and it is no big deal. I have been eating what I feel like for a couple years and my weight has stayed basically the same. There is no guilt. As long as I have balanced meals and snacks around, that is what I eat. I do make sure I eat protien at every meal.

She is frankly a pretty messy/disorganized/forgetful person and frequently leaves the kitchen and living room (common areas) a mess with used dishware, crumbs/pieces of food on the couch, remnants all over the stove, dirty dishes in the sink for days, etc.

This reeks of severe depression to me. I know because I have severe depression and do all of these things. (Except leave crumbs because pets take care of that). Obviously she also has an eating disorder but that's not the whole story. The depression and ED are probably feeding into each other, making both worse.

The trick is figuring out HOW to eat less without it being a huge, constant battle with yourself. 

The weight loss industry is all about how to fight yourself so that you are eating “right.” That apparently works for some people, but most people end up backsliding if they ever see much success at all because fighting yourself daily is HARD.

I made a few changes over a year ago like: use smaller plates and don’t eat dinner in front of the tv.

Then sometime last year, in the comments on some diet tip in this very thread, someone said your level of hunger tells you HOW SOON you need to eat, not how much. And that’s something that never clicked for me before. But I started trying to be mindful of it. 

And wouldn’t you know it, with no calorie counting or measuring or food restrictions or any other major changes in diet, I’ve lost around 30lbs or more in the last year. 

I’ve realized in that time I had unnecessary rules about food that weren’t helping me: don’t spoil your dinner (by snacking in the evening), clear your plate, etc. Giving myself PERMISSION to eat when I’m hungry instead of at prescribed times, including “wait a little while and if I’m still hungry I’ll eat more” has been really transformational for me.",11i8714,jaxfb6h,2023-03-04 20:32:48

Working out and eating right feels good. Binge eating and skipping the gym does not. Don't let your lizard brain trick you into getting it backwards.,"Since I started losing weight I've become really annoyed by the way the world uses the word 'deserve'. I feel like we're constantly told - mainly by marketing and advertising - that we 'deserve' indulgences. You DESERVE a donut, a new dress, a holiday - and hang the consequences. It's a marketing strategy that plays directly into the tendency of humans to trade things off against each other: I had a shitty day at work, so I deserve a chocolate bar. I had a good workout, so I deserve a rest day. But in reality, those events or choices are independent of each other, and no matter how we rationalise them, they still have consequences. 

I've fundamentally changed the way I interpret the word 'deserve' when I see it or when I think it. I deserve to have savings and financial comfort, which means I don't deal with stress by buying things I can't afford. I deserve to live in a body that I like and that is a healthy weight, so I don't really want that donut today. Maybe tomorrow. I deserve to be strong and physically capable, so I'm getting my butt to the gym. ",ax9ymt,eht2ak3,2019-03-05 00:38:12

Do you struggle with binge eating?,"Yes. First and foremost, please consider seeking professional resources on disordered eating. I've been in ED recovery for years and it's very easy to swap a binge eating habit for a restrictive eating habit if only relying on personal advice from individuals. 

What has helped me the most is focus on nourishing foods earlier in the day. I nearly force feed myself breakfast to ensure that I am starting the day well fed. I am not any sort of medical professional however in my own recovery I understand that I and many people are most likely to binge when we are not well nourished. Often a misguided response to binging is to aggressively restrict food after the fact however that drives a vicious cycle. 

Another huge contributor to binge eating impulses for me that I also understand is common for others is guilt and self doubt and self hatred and self criticism etc. One of the intensive pillars in ED recovery is removing guilt and shame and any sense of morality from food and eating. Food is for nourishment and enjoyment, not something that should be punished. 

Forgive me if any of this comes across as sanctimonious, and I hope at least a bit of it is helpful.",ognru5,h4keb4k,2021-07-09 07:01:25

Do you struggle with binge eating?,"This is accurate. Vyvanse was prescribed to me to help my binge eating which had morphed into bulimia. Vyvanse fucked me up, causing acne (not a listed side effect, so nobody believed me), stress, and exacerbating anxiety. My poor skin, I picked at it so much. However, I am so grateful for that medicine, because it is what led doctors to discovering that I have ADHD. That diagnosis has changed my life. I still struggle with eating, instant gratification, self-image/love, but knowing a big component of the “why” helps me cope and develop strategies. Of course therapy and different medication help as well. Apparently, my body processed Vyvanse in an odd way, so that I shot up and shut down incredibly quickly as opposed to the slow up and down release it normally gives. I don’t get it and I don’t care.

Would you say something to another mom if her kid binge-eating sweets during playdates?,"There could be a lot of things going on here. I've known kids with very restrictive parents who were NEVER allowed to have sweets at home, so all that happened is that instead of developing a healthy relationship with food, they learned to sneak the ""bad"" stuff and they'd gorge on it at any opportunity. On the other hand one of my kids also had a friend who was very poor, and he'd raid my pantry any time he came over. He wasn't on a sugar rush, he was just hungry. I told that kid he could eat anything he wanted. 

Severe sugar cravings can also be a sign of a medical condition, so I wouldn't necessarily keep this a secret from the parents, but considering that other things might be at play, I'd tread really carefully here.

She was in therapy for it. It wasnt a restrictive home environment that caused it in this case so i would be more inclined to talk to her parents.",1jzclht,mn5cxcq,2025-04-14 23:38:15
Would you say something to another mom if her kid binge-eating sweets during playdates?,"I’d be worried that home was so strict with sweets that she thinks she needs to get her fix at your house and keep it a secret. I’d casually bring up, “What kinda of sweets do you have at your house?” That could go to either the parent or kid. Or both. If you need a reason, maybe just say, you want to let the girls have some sweets next time and wanted to see what was allowed/what the girl liked. 

I have almost always treated sweets as a regular food. We didn’t make it extra special. If they wanted one piece, they got it. I’d give them their cookie with their dinner. They still will occasionally get a sweet tooth and sneak a few extra pieces. That’s usually right after a candy holiday bc it’s all new and exciting.

Would you say something to another mom if her kid binge-eating sweets during playdates?,"I second this 100%. My 9yo daughter has had friends that showed behaviors exactly like what OP describes, and it was because their parents were so called ""health nuts"" who demonized sugar as ""bad for you"" and didn't allow them to have candy or any kind of sweets in the house unless for special occasions like Halloween. So they gorged on it the rare occasions they were allowed to have it and when they were at someone else's house, and were known to sneak and hide things too. I'm going to be really surprised if they don't end up with eating disorders in a few years. My mom wasn't as extreme but placed a lot of shame around eating sweets to the point I would do similar things (eat it when she wasn't around to tell me I was going to gain weight for everything), and it definitely messed up my self image and relationship with food. NGL, I would have *hated* it if my friend's parents had told her about ""unhealthy"" food I ate at their houses because it would have just given her more ammunition. 

I definitely agree to tread carefully and do this exact thing of asking the kid first, because if this sneaking and gorging behavior is because of overly restrictive  and/or abusive parents, she could face repercussions at home.",1jzclht,mn5giz3,2025-04-14 23:59:06

Would you say something to another mom if her kid binge-eating sweets during playdates?,"Why not? 

Like genuinely, why not eat a cookie *with* dinner? What is the issue? (I can definitely see why “instead of” is an issue, but “with”? 

Like is it just because it doesn’t gel with what your construct of what “dinner” looks like? So you just “shouldn’t” ?

This method is based on research by Ellyn Satter called division of responsibility feeding and the purpose is to “normalise” treats to help kids learn to better understand their hunger and satiety cues - including stuff like a healthy approach to treat food. 

I know plenty of adults who say stuff like “well the cookie was there so I *had* to eat it!” Without actually listening to if their body wants it or not. Most likely these adults grew up with treats being limited so they don’t have a great approach to managing treat food. This happens because the treat food is restricted so human nature is to want it even more. 

It’s worth looking into the methodology and research to get a better understanding of why this might be a method worth perusing https://www.ellynsatterinstitute.org",1jzclht,mn5clqu,2025-04-14 23:36:22

I try to remind myself that I will only regret it the next day but these repeat cravings often times will get to me - and you're right once it's a little piece of brownie, it's all over. - a small piece is never enough.

The answer on how to ACTUALLY stop binge eating - Ride the Craving Wave!,"another thing I have discovered is making sure you eat enough!

It was a weird concept I had to work with in rehab because Binge eating literally is overeating...

But when I saw that throughout the day I wasn't feeding myself adequately, it made sense that I would do a massive binge at the end of the night.

If you think about it, the things we binge aren't really nutritious at all, so we're missing out on the good stuff the body needs that isn't found much in the binged food.

I'm no professional, but eating enough throughout the day and not cutting calories too short for faster weight loss is what truly got me this far in recovery. I no longer have these compulsive cravings because my body isn't deprived of what it needs anymore.

&#x200B;

Therfore those who are losing weight and have a binging problem, look at whether you are over-restriciting or not. Slow weight loss is sustainable weight loss.

This is mainly my opinion, but hope it provides perspective to someone :)

There is also a mental aspect in binge eating, so while I think this helped, working through that side also helped me a TON",pm6v5t,hcguzya,2021-09-11 19:09:07
The answer on how to ACTUALLY stop binge eating - Ride the Craving Wave!,"This is really great and very similar to what they teach you in mindfulness meditation, especially in how to deal with negative emotions. You observe your emotion (or craving) without judgement and then realize that all emotions (and cravings) are temporary and will pass. This way you’re an observer to your emotions and cravings instead of being swept away by them. The analogy is like standing off to the side watching a dog running around a yard going crazy vs. holding on to the dog’s leash.

Anyone else been binge eating since childhood?,"yes. I have very embarrassing memories. there was a time we went to a festival, hot summer day. a restaurant was handing out cookies, my mom had already gotten some for the family but I wondered back and carelessly scooped my hand back into the pan of very fragile chocolate chip cookies sitting in 80 degree weather. the women standing there holding the pans, jaws hit the floor. overweight 8 year old with no shame digging their melted chocolate covered hands in their cookie pan. no doubt I ruined that batch.

then being 12 I ate 4 plates of food at my grandma's house, well after everyone was done I was still eating. my mom saying ""oh she's on her period"" I was not. and she truly believed I was because I was then forced to go in with her to buy pads. passing one of my teachers holding them on the way to check out. if I actually had been on my period, none or at least less of that would've felt so shameful. 

then I was 16, my sisters pulled a pizza out of the oven and then went to play outside. I'd walk back and forth, sneaking a piece each time. until it was gone because it had felt like I blacked out and had no control. hearing them come in being so confused, until they came in my room and asked me about it. they knew and I denied. god I hate myself.

Two other things that really helped me with after-dinner eating:

 - go for a walk (not possible for everyone but a great new habit and breaking the temptation by literally walking away from your pantry really helps)

 - intsead of thinking of some treat or food and struggling with telling myself "" NO- you cant eat that"" I tell myself ""YES- you CAN eat that - *tomorrow*, for breakfast. you can eat whatever you want, tomorrow, for breakfast."" so it's not a ""no"" it's a ""yes, but after your nap."" The only thing I have to do before I can eat whatever I want is sleep. easy, right?

This is going to sound so bitchy and negative. But for some weird reason, constantly seeing people suggest drinking tea to fix *everything* from hunger to anxiety to sleeplessness, or to ""treat yourself!!"" during self care, drives me up the wall.

Maybe it's because I'm not a big tea person (I don't hate it; I just don't care about it and I'm a coffee person), but it always makes me roll my eyes.

How on Earth do you stop binge eating for comfort when you are depressed?,"I found 'The Binge Code' by Alison Kerr helpful.

I eat when I'm fighting my feelings. I'm trying to learn how to be with them but I fucking hate them. In recent months I started to relapse (alcohol) and realized quick that I needed to start reaching out for help. So I pick up the phone instead of food. It helps me to let someone distract me long enough to get out of my head and let the shitty feelings diminish. When I can't reach anyone I cry and journal, even if all I can write is ""This is so stupid"" x500.  

I had been powerlifting for 4 yrs to help with emotional release. It was super helpful to keep anxiety & depression at bay. But like everything, I pushed too hard, got burnt out, life happened, covid ruined everything & I turned back to food. 

With the recent wake-up call I've redoubled my efforts to get comfortable with being uncomfortable, stop eating my feelings and get back in the gym. I'm a few kg from my competition weight, and being under the bar is the best worst time I can imagine having =D I feel like hell, but my head & heart are clear and light.

Best wishes to you. I hope you find what you need.",r0kjo7,hlt5fyv,2021-11-23 20:04:21
How on Earth do you stop binge eating for comfort when you are depressed?,"If food is the only thing that brings you joy, you can’t take that away and not expect your life to collapse. You have to swap something in to prop it up. Is there anything you REALLY enjoy doing? Drawing, reading, exercising, video games, writing, journaling, any type of hobby? Something you really get lost in? This is your opportunity to let yourself get fully invested in that. Any time you feel like you want to binge, immediately substitute it with something you really love. You can also write down 5 things you’re grateful for when you get an urge. 

Addiction impulses come from not having enough stimulation and feeling shame and hopelessness. But it’s really hard to understand that when you’re stuck in it. Good luck!",r0kjo7,hlt7vxg,2021-11-23 20:20:24

How on Earth do you stop binge eating for comfort when you are depressed?,"I tell myself ""not today"". It's not never, it's just me saying out loud that I don't want that today, it helps cultivate self control and actually feels kinda good knowing that I'm not a slave to my low mood.

Every time that low mood strikes ""not today"".

Another useful trick is to think about how you're feeling right now, if you know you're just feeling low you can verbalise it. ""I don't really want that, I'm just feeling low right now and that will just make me feel worse"".

It's hard sometimes and eventually you may give in but even if you just stop yourself doing it every other time, it is still a victory you can build on until you are truly the master of what you really want. Best of luck! I believe in you!",r0kjo7,hltmjmg,2021-11-23 21:56:31

How on Earth do you stop binge eating for comfort when you are depressed?,"I saw a reddit post earlier this year that said to approach a diet/lifestyle change the way you would approach meditation. When you're learning to meditate, you're supposed to clear your mind and focus on your breathing. If a thought slips into your mind, you don't stop and give up, you let it go and refocus on your breath. 

When you slip up in your diet/lifestyle and choose something unhealthy, don't give up. Be kind to yourself, let it go, and come back to healthy living at the next opportunity. 

This mental shift has really helped reduce the shame spiral that comes after binging. Not feeling the shame so much has really helped with the feelings of apathy that usually come before a binge. Each pizza really does matter. Taking a long walk will make a difference. After 6 months of trying to be healthier, I'm finally actually making better choices with food. I've been overweight/obese my whole adult life and this is the first time that I feel in control of my body and health.

"I don't like people telling me ""It's okay to have one cheat day"" and trying to pressure me into binge eating.","For me, the idea of “let’s have a cheat day!” is more of a “c’mon, don’t be responsible because that’ll remind me that I should be responsible and make me feel bad.” Being a lifelong fat person, I’ve always been surrounded by people who leaned on me to justify their own indulgence or depended on me to do things like split appetizers with them (“I can’t eat all that by myself…you just gotta have some to help me with it!”) to keep them from feeling wasteful. I had to start to be fierce in protecting my boundaries around food and my intake. My husband is the type to say something like “c’mon, there isn’t much left, let’s just finish this” and I had to learn to be super firm in only eating what I wanted to eat. I’m full when I say I am, period. My diet/eating pattern/preferred intake is not up for debate, it’s not there to make anyone else comfortable, it’s not going to be decided by anyone other than me, PERIOD. DOT. End of sentence. If I want a cheat meal/day, it’ll be because I decided to have it, not anyone else. If I want a bite that’s been offered to me, I’ll accept it, but it’s my choice, not theirs. 

One of my dietary commandments is this: *I will not eat out of obligation any longer.* 

It’s actually been very liberating. I never realized how often I was eating things in my house to run out leftovers, for example, or because my mother in law gave us a bag of snacks that we opened but that no one else wanted to eat. 

My language has changed as well - there’s nothing I *can’t* have, but there’s a lot of stuff I just *don’t* or *won’t* eat because I value myself more. I’m eating better for me because I deserve better. It’s been super empowering.",u01ipn,i43hfc7,2022-04-09 23:23:14

That leads directly to a lack of motivation and can mean me giving up entirely.

I broke it, and tried again, and got a two week streak. I broke it, and tried again, and now I am on a streak lasting all the way to now.

I honestly don’t know if any would recommend calorie counting to someone with an ED. If someone is able to remedy the emotional reasons of binge eating, then they will be able to lose weight without focusing on their intake by way of no longer binge eating.

Mental health professionals also will tailor what they say to clients to keep if helpful, they hold back A LOT. Perhaps this one didn’t want to add an extra layer of guilt that the effects of binge eating are potentially causing health issues because they thought it might cause more harm. Or for any other reason.

Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"A lot of good advice here to consider.  This will probably be buried beneath all the comments but I will say I was in the exact same situation as you a few months ago.  Binging and constant overeating, so I sought a nutritionist that specializes in eating disorders.  She told me the same thing - stop tracking.  Stop trying stupid fasts so I could ""eat more at dinner"" and trying to convince myself that wasn't just a hidden excuse to binge.  Stop completely obsessing about *every single calorie* in *every single bite of food* during the morning and afternoon, only to become fatigued with the decisions by the evening, throw in the towel and become **The Eatbeast**.  

The way she explained intuitive eating to me was this; it's not just about say, eating half a chocolate cake because I want it and crave it.  Sure, give in to the craving and have a slice of cake because nothing is truly off limits.  But it's also taking a step back and trying to tune into my body - did I get enough protein today?  Enough water?  Enough insert-macro-here?  Intuitive eating is also about what is serving your body properly and learning to recognize what it needs.  She said CICO absolutely works - for those who do not have eating disorders.  The people without eating disorders know they just have to scale back and don't give it nearly as much thought as ED patients.  

Did I also roll my eyes and secretly vow to conquer binge eating *and* lose weight at the same time?  *Absolutely.*  Did it actually work?  That's a big fat *fuck no it did not*.  

So I let go.  I temporarily deleted the tracking apps off my phone and focused on getting enough protein during my day as well as enough water.  Hydration has always been an issue with me, I have suspicions I am part camel.  Trust me, it definitely sucked at first.  I was anxious as hell about just *not knowing* how much I was consuming.  So much so in fact, I naturally scaled back my portions.  I ate my protein, drank my water... I also had my chocolate cake.  And reese's.  And salad.  And pasta.  And whatever I wanted.

6 weeks into this whole lame not tracking bullshit, I hopped on the scale.  6.8 pounds down.  Oh.  Um... *hm*.  I guess the Registered Dietician does know more than Eatbeast Exogen.",pym9qr,hewe1u7,2021-09-30 21:21:01

Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"> Nobody's gonna save you but you.

If this is true why did you post here? You've got a lot of people telling you to reconsider in this thread. Why expose yourself to that if you were entirely convinced?

Speaking of convincing here's my story:

I've had Binge Eating Disorder since I was 10. I topped out at 365, which was the weight I was at two years ago when I finally took the scary step of moving away from fad diets, counting calories, and restrictive eating towards something akin to IE. I mean it when I say it was scary -- I felt the same way you do. Right up until the day I did it I had been trying on and off for two years to complete a potato only fast. I'd got a couple days and then binge. 

I never went to a binge eating therapist, but I read enough to know what they'd suggest. So, I went to the store and bought a bunch of ingredients and foods I'd developed phobias around: meat, cheese, sugar, flour, peanut butter. I also got lots of fruits and veggies and grains and legumes. 

I only had one rule: If I wanted to eat it I was going to make it myself.

Over the next year I tried to not count calories or macros. Turns out that undoing that habit felt as difficult as undoing my binge eating. It felt unsafe to just eat what I wanted when I was hungry. But I did it, and turns out it worked when I let it.

To skip to the end I will reveal I lost 105 lbs in a year. I went from 365 to 260. It was not a linear path -- there were many hiccups along the way. But it was not with what I ate, it was with how I approached food. 


When I didn't count or track it became much easier to listen to my body. Did I still overeat sometimes? You bet! But you know what? I began to realize what made me feel bad and I adjusted my eating. I realized too much peanut butter made me feel heavy and bloated so I cut back. I realized having dried fruit in the house led to late night snacking, so I made sure I only bought fresh fruit. If I Really wanted some raisins or something I bought a small package on the day I bought groceries, as a treat.

I began to feel better both physically and mentally, but it was still a struggle.

There were times when I went back to weighing myself twice a day and counting calories because I didn't ""FEEL"" like I was losing weight. Why? Well losing weight was suppose to feel hard. It didn't feel hard, so I must be doing something wrong. When I began to repeat those behaviors I began to gain weight; because with them came the binging. I came to see how binging was a direct result of my dieting behaviors.

At the end of the year I moved to a new situation with more stressors, and with those stressors the urge to engage in dieting behavior re-emerged. Long story short, I gave up on the intuitive eating and I gained all the weight back. 

I'm back where I started physically and mentally. The fear, surprisingly, returned about dropping the dieting behavior. My mother had OCD and I'm aware now that my dieting behavior may have an OCD component to it.

Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"She is trying to treat your BED, not your obesity. As someone who has actually been through eating disorder treatment, first step for everyone is to reduce food hang ups and often “reverse diet”. Reverse dieting was a shit time for me but it worked. 

She’s thinking the long game, you’re thinking the short game. You need to start at the root of the problem before you can have long term success. 

I know it’s hard to see how not restricting will help you lose weight but people with any eating disorder are not like other people, mentally. CICO works for other people because they don’t have food hang ups and the restriction is not a mental battle (beyond thinking “want chip”). 

If you don’t want to struggle through the binge/restrict cycle for the rest of your life you need to do something about your mental disorder. I’m sorry, it’s harsh but it’s true.",pym9qr,hewg2ov,2021-09-30 21:35:47
Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"Hey OP, I’m gathering that you don’t think restriction is what’s triggering your binges, right? If not, what do you think are the triggers?

Because, if it is in fact over restriction and hunger cues that are triggers for a binge, then getting out of calorie counting and into basic nutrition (making sure you get regular, balanced, healthy meals with plenty of vegetables, whole grains/complex carbs, fats, and proteins) will really help with cutting down the binge cycle - long term this will help with weight loss. Once you’re more balanced and not binging you can try out more sustainable calorie cutting methods. And in the mean time, simply by not binging you’ll probably lose weight if you’re obese now. 

If it’s not hunger or restriction and you truly don’t think it is, then definitely explore elsewhere. Maybe it’s untreated ADHD, maybe you’re self medicating with food to cover some other trauma, maybe your brain got addicted to dopamine rushes, who knows. But that’s definitely worth exploring maybe more clearly with either this expert or a different therapist.",pym9qr,hevhsod,2021-09-30 17:31:55

Halfway through the book I started eating massive amounts of food even though I wasn't hungry.  I gained 5 pounds in a couple of weeks.  IE isn't an option for me.

If you're a binge eater, you're not really looking for a weight loss plan.  You're looking for a way to stop (or at least curb) the urge to binge.  If I could eat intuitively - I wouldn't be in this situation.  Counting calories and carb grams and macros is probably what brought on my increased urge to binge.  The cycle of famine/feast/famine was ruining my life.

For now I have become much more active.  I'm working with an RD who created a meal plan for me.  I haven't calculated calories.  I follow the plan.  For right now it is a tremendous mental relief to not have to think about calories and carbs and what if I fail again scenarios.  I'm letting the calories mind themselves while I focus on working out, meeting a water drinking goal, a step goal and a sleep goal.  It's a good distraction from the things that triggered my binges.

Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,">I get that, only this therapist specifically said she was against CICO. 

I doubt your therapist is against the basic principles of thermodynamics. **However**, nutrition, fitness, and weight really are about much more than CICO – especially because the ""CO"" half can be a lot more variable, even for the same person at different times and weights, than you might think. 

Roughly speaking, CICO is like Newtonian physics – it works okay enough for many situations that it shouldn't be completely discarded. A lot of hardcore fitness people who are already at a nominal BMI (19-25) do well with it. ***But it's the wrong central dogma for understanding obesity.***

Leptin and insulin sensitivity (and resistance), for instance, matter a lot. So does metabolic adaptation. If you've watched any of [Stephan Guyenet's videos](https://youtu.be/vgFY4g5a7gk?t=637), he points out that obese people who lose a significant amount of weight also see their metabolism per unit lean mass fall – their brain-body-hormonal complex actively tries to conserve fat, sometimes at the expense of organ and muscular health and performance. This can be reversed either with extra infusions of leptin (which you can't really get outside of a clinical setting) or with resistance training and protein intake. My understanding is this is dose-dependent – the more aggressively you attempt to lose weight, the worse this adaptation is.

This is why nobody who has an informed approach to weight loss recommends big deficits exceeding 500 calories a day. It's also why calorie-counting yourself into a steep deficit might not be working, and may in fact create uncontrollable cravings for food later.

IE and HAES don't say ""your weight doesn't matter, eat whatever you want."" An IE-based program administered through a therapist is fundamentally about fixing your relationship with food so that you aren't starving or binging. It all begins with removing arbitrary restrictions, along with the emotional weight of shame, etc. from food. The early stages of that treatment often are ""eat whatever you want"" simply to eliminate the cravings that come from excessive restriction. Later on, they will promote a more nutritionally sound approach.",pym9qr,hew8rn4,2021-09-30 20:43:37

I don’t know the science of cico, I’m not arguing against it. But I’m managing my binging by adding more meals and snacks during the day. I’m not worried at all about counting calories or dieting right now, just managing the binging and just adding more healthy meals has helped me lose a bunch of weight and almost no binging.

Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"Maybe she's an idiot. In it's most basic form, CICO is true, otherwise you're denying physics.

But the fact is, counting calories simply doesn't have a good track record of helping people lose and maintain weight. For most people, counting calories is annoying, boring, and burdensome, and they stop doing it when they hit their GW in the best case scenario. Then they revert to their old habits which led them to being overweight, and gain it all back. In the more common scenario, life gets stressful and the person breaks their diet long before reaching their goal weight, and del's with their life stress by binging, often ending up heavier than before. It's possible she meant that she doesn't believe in calorie counting as a reliably effective way to keep weight off in the long term.

Same with health at every size. Anyone who isn't an idiot realizes that being morbidly obese is, well.... morbid. But the good side of HAES is that it says that you can be a healthy person with healthy habits, even if you are overweight. This is typically helpful for people with BEDs because it allows them to accept where they are right now and focus on behavior change, instead of focusing on the result, which could very well lead to more binging when the person tries starving themselves in order to accelerate progress. 

Honestly, if you already have a BED, this is probably the way you should go.  Binging is typically used as a coping mechanism for stressful life situations. Counting calories and pinning your happiness on seeing the number on the scale go down is stressful. Counting calories doesn't teach you helpful strategies for dealing with life's stressors. Counting calories is not something 99% of people do after they lose weight.

The great irony is that, when followed reasonably, IE and HAES philosophies will reliably lead to sustainable fat loss. When you eat 3 squares per day, but turn down seconds most of the time; include whole foods, lots of fiber, and protein in your meals; only drink calories on special occasions; turn down dessert most of the time; exercise regularly; get plenty of quality sleep each night; and cope with life stressors by taking a walk or talking with friends... Do that for a couple years, and you'll be hard pressed *not* to be in shape!

But I mean, if you're really opposed to this, go find someone else. Therapists differ in their philosophies and demeanor, and shopping around for a therapist who suits you is definitely a thing. But if your plan for losing weight and keeping it off is to track calories and macros for the rest of your life, you need a bodybuilding coach, not a therapist.",pym9qr,hevn4pb,2021-09-30 18:08:50

A medium cucumber has about the same volume as a Big Mac (not saying you're eating fast food, just a  fairly consistent size example). However, a medium cucumber has about 50 calories while a Big Mac has about 563 calories. That's a HUGE difference in CICO value.

If you're off-put or triggered by advice to eat more, consider maybe adding ""less calorie-dense"" to her advice. Eat more food that is less calorie dense. Eat more of the less calorie-dense food more often to keep you full. Obviously, you still need protein and carbs and fat, in the right amounts, so it can't be all cucumbers all day long.

I want to share that it took me many months of therapy and then working with a nutritionist (who worked with nutrient “points”, not counting) to accept the idea that I had to let go of the control I wanted to have in order to overcome my binge eating. It is counter-intuitive. It’s a frustrating idea. I remember rolling my eyes in my head when my therapist told me that I should stop counting calories and stop cutting out certain foods. And when she told me to start eating what I wanted when I wanted it. 

I desperately wanted to believe that I could overcome my binge eating WHILE continuing to restrict my intake/lose weight/maintain weight. 1) I was wrong and that was why I needed help in the first place and 2) I not only overcame my binge eating with those tactics, but I started to lose weight as well. 

Because the key is that the binge eating is often coming from a guilt and shame perspective, which perpetuates itself. When you let go of control, you stop feeling the urge to binge constantly. Not right away, but over time. Now, I eat so many foods I had previously cut out and I weigh less than I did when I was restricting, binging, and miserable.

Binge-eating disorder (only late at night) - what worked for you guys?,"You have developed some bad habits. Some behavior modification is in order. You can see a professional if it you can't fix it yourself. Suggestions:

&#x200B;

1. Go to sleep earlier and get up earlier. Sounds simple, but it worked for me.
2. Eat a little more during your regular meals, especially protein.
3. Binge on healthy food. I switched to a salad or some carrots. Or an egg. 2 eggs and a piece of toast have the same number of calories as a chocolate bar, and you feel full and get a lot more nutrients.
4. Brush your teeth immediately after dinner.
5. Don't buy any junk/binge food. When you look in your pantry there will be nothing to binge on and you will give up.

When you are working out a lot you definitely get hunger cravings. It always happens to me when I use >1500 cal in a single workout.  A few (1/2 oz) of almonds or nuts really seems to slow it down half way through the workout. Afterwards, I have a yogurt and a banana, or something light to tide me over until my next meal.",fooqo4,flgdg1i,2020-03-25 12:34:15

Binge-eating disorder (only late at night) - what worked for you guys?,"so I've been in therapy for BED for 2 years and one thing that is constantly brought up is that if you are severely under eating for most of the day, you are setting yourself up to binge at night.

Binge-eating disorder (only late at night) - what worked for you guys?,"Like you said, once you start, you can’t stop. So you need to figure out what helps you not start. For me, different stuff has helped at different times. 

- IF helped sometimes, either saving ALL of my calories for after 8pm or cutting myself off completely before 9pm and staying in bed the rest of the night. 
- when I couldn’t resist the urge, only allowing myself to binge but only on low calorie foods like garden salad with light Italian dressing or broccoli with seasoning. Gets you full and takes a long time to eat for relatively few calories. 
- flavoured water, ice water and diet pop helped me feel like I was getting enough of a treat 
- keeping all junk food or trigger foods out of the house
- getting distractions that kept me away from the kitchen. Keep your brain and hands busy. Video games, reading, knitting, painting, going to the gym at night (with no money so you can’t stop for food after), doing YouTube video workouts, whatever. 
- if there is emotional eating involved here, work on feeling your feelings and learning how to deal with them instead of drowning them in food
- be forgiving with yourself if you do binge. The last thing someone with a binge eating disorder where they hate themselves for binging needs is to beat themselves up, causing more negative feelings that lead to more binges.
- eating higher calorie or treat foods throughout the day or upping your calorie budget so you don’t feel restricted",fooqo4,flgrigs,2020-03-25 15:08:14
Binge-eating disorder (only late at night) - what worked for you guys?,"This sounded weird to me, but it's from my nutritionist, so I trust her.

&#x200B;

>If you feel compelled to eat a lot at night right before bed, most likely you didn't get enough during the day.  The problem is that late at night your activity level is at it's lowest and your will power is at it's lowest, so that's the most dangerous time to re-fill your body.

&#x200B;

* Make sure you are filling your body with good foods.  Lean protein, no trans fats, complex carbs.
* Make sure you are getting what you need during the day, but not more than you need.
* If you do need to refuel late at night, it should be with lean protein.  Seltzer waters & SALTED bone broths are also good for curbing cravings.
* In general, Get those hyper sugary sweets out of your house.  Instead of chocolate bars try  a chocolate flavored Greek yogurt with some berries or Apples in a nut butter.  These have some sugar, of course, but it's miles better than downing 5 chocolate bars.
* Exercise your will power at the store, not at home.  Eat a meal before you go to the store, and stick to the list.  If you don't buy junk food there won't be junk food.
* I found it helpful to cap my eating times.  I don't eat anything after 8:00.
* Going cold turkey was a huge problem for me.  Allow yourself one chocolate bar per week.  ONE!!  Not two, not one per day, ONE!  If you only buy one, there will only be one, so don't buy in bulk.  
* Try to switch to a dark chocolate.  Dark chocolate has between 10-15 grams of sugar instead of 30+ grams.

&#x200B;

Being mindful about what you eat is the key here.  Let's say you ignore all of us and eat Candy until the day you die.  

* A Snickers has 250+ calories and nearly 40 grams of sugar.  
* A Charleston Chew has 160 Calories and 30 grams of sugar.
* A 70% Dark chocolate bar has 210 calories but only 18 grams of sugar.

Even if you made no other changes (which you should), you cut your sugar intake by HALF when you choose Dark Chocolate at the store.",fooqo4,flgouwu,2020-03-25 14:42:41

I think it's the fact that you are providing just the slightest obstacle to the impulse. Normally you'd just act on it and go fail, but now you're thinking, ""I just brushed my teeth so after this I'm going to either have the taste in my mouth all night or I'm going to have to go brush again."" Just that tiny hindrance to it is very frequently enough to stop the impulse on its own.

However, when I started to consciously came up with reasons to ignore the voice, e.g. ""just see if you can do without it once..."", or ""if you *really* want it you can come back and have it soon..."", I ended up slowly building up a store of occasions when I knew I'd resisted overeating, which I could use as evidence that I was able to abstain without it bothering me at all in either the short- or long-term.",g2v0wh,fnol5ar,2020-04-17 12:54:05

I find that for whatever reason - maybe because it’s not wheat flour or white sugar - I have my treat or whatever and I’m good and I can move on and I don’t want more.

If she wents through the troubles to smuggle their triggers to an addict-in-recovery , and says ""you deserve a break"" , just saying nicely No won't work.
Panicking and having her removed by the security was the best option, as she clearly wouldn't be the one stopping herself from bringig their TRIGGERS TO AN ADDICT.

And I would be very cautious when you go out of the program. If she is trying to sabotage you while you are in your program, chances are she would try the same after you got home. She need to be educated/educate herself about how to live with an addict and what to do and what to avoid, elsewhere you won't be able to get out of your addiction.",1dh4p0g,l8ug15z,2024-06-16 11:08:26

Anyway, I see what you wife did as the same as if she would've bought in drugs while u was in rehab. When you're addicted/have eating disorders u cant really ""take a break"" the risk of starting the downward spiral once again is simply too high. Especially only after the first months time

And I bet part of u really wanted to eat thoose snacks and not call for help 

So she kinda had u up in a corner, so u probably called for help because u knew it would represent a big step backwards for u. And u felt somewhat trapped

Or this is atleast what would be the reasoning for me if I was in rehab for example",1dh4p0g,l8us9px,2024-06-16 13:02:27

AITAH for reporting my wife for bringing me snacks in the hospital?,"NTA. First off what the hell was your wife thinking?

Seriously good for you for doing what you needed to protect yourself. Maybe she is completely clueless and has good intentions but she’s hurting you. If her intentions were to sabotage your progress I’m wondering just how high a life insurance payout is she hoping for. No joke and I’m sure you already know this but you’re at risk of dying.

Edited to add:  What others have pointed out she SMUGGLED them in. That’s not clueless, that’s someone who:

Actively took steps to buy your favorite snacks. 

Went through the trouble to smuggle them in

Tempted you with them while playing into you deserving a reward

Gaslit you by acting like you could have handled it differently.

This is such a serious issue for you to have and you seem to be at a point where you are making real change. For her to act like it's no big deal is minimizing the challenge you are dealing with. My boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic. I would NEVER bring him alcohol or even put him in a situation where we are around heavy drinking. I can't even imagine suggesting he ""needs a break"" from sobriety. I have also basically stopped drinking because I want to support him so much (never really cared for it anyways). You guys definitely need to have a big conversation about this. She needs to realize how serious this is for you if she doesn't already. Food addiction/BED is extremely hard because we can't just stop eating. This will be years of hard work and she needs to get on the train now. 

Also, as someone who struggles with food and my weight myself, I just wanted to say good for you for doing the work. This shit isn't easy and it seems like you really are going for it.

A woman I worked with had a fat husband. None of my business. I only met him a handful of times when he stopped by the office.

There was a guy in the office who was truly obese. Like, close to 400lb. He resolved to change. Dude brought a scale in and measured out oatmeal for lunch. He started dropping weight. Naturally, it looked a bit odd because his skin started hanging lose.

The woman with the fat husband sees him one day, and starts shaking her head. She says to me quietly, ""that can't be healthy!""

It was honestly so sad that they had been shamed so much they fell right into the praise and affection of it, I can see why someone who doesn't judge would be so alluring. 

But it progressed to the point their partner was talking about them eventually being bedbound and how hot that would be, and they escaped after their partner refused to take them to hospital when they got sick. They realised this person wasn't enjoying a 'kink' anymore, they were literally trying to murder them slowly.

Absolutely. And the fact that if she was going to bring anything, she didn't bring like... Her homemade whatever or his favorite thing in a small amount (which would be misguided and wrong but not necessarily malicious). She brought his biggest binge eating snacks. And encouraged him to 'take a break' - ie: ""Binge, I won't tell"" 

I wonder if she is 'just' enabling him or actively contributing to his disorder deliberately as some kind of insecurity or abuse ('if he gets better he'll leave' or 'if he gets better he won't be as easy to control')?

Since she is average sized, it could be driven by a fear that she’ll lose you, either because she is no longer the provider of your previous lifestyle, or a fear that if you lose the weight you’ll leave her for someone else.

That the person with an ED just needs to try harder. It's anecdotal, but this is a slightly more for common response than actually accepting someone has a serious issue with something that is absolutely needed to survive. And it's a far more likely explanation than a feeder. It doesn't guarantee that they aren't a feeder, it's just more likely they view the restrictions and requirements as excessive or unnecessary.

Most people in this day and age understand that an alcoholic can't just have one drink every now and then because the risk of that one drink turning into ten and that one night turning into every night is just too high. What most people don't seem to be able to do is recognise the equivalent behaviour in food addictions. Those snacks are a treat in her mind, and if he's making good progress he deserves a treat.

"NSV- I suffer from Binge Eating Disorder. Today, I ordered Chipotle and didn’t eat it all in one sitting.","That's awesome!

Just want to say something about BED, since it's so new (only formally recognized in 2017).

Some people like OP have the sheer willpower and discipline to overcome BED on their own.

I did not.

There is ONE medication called Vyvanse which is approved for treating BED.  It is normally used for treating ADHD in teens, but it's also approved as an effective treatment for BED.  It's a controlled drug, so you need a prescription from a doctor (try to find an eating disorder clinic in your area, because BED is so new, most docs have never heard of it and won't prescribe.  And there's no formal ""eating disorder specialist"" designation for docs, but an ED clinic should have a doc on staff with experience, who may be willing to prescribe).

In May, I lost 20 lbs.  In June, July, and Aug I lost about 5lbs per month.

BED is a mental disorder (per my super basic understanding) where my brain does not create enough dopamine (the pleasure/reward hormone).  When we eat, we feel pleasure because dopamine is being released.  A BED person's dopamine levels are not at the normal baseline, so we (almost like addicts) desperately seek out dopamine through massive binges, even though we are trying to stop.  So you'll be filling your plate with junk thinking, ""I shouldn't be eating this, I'm breaking my diet.  I'm going to regret it later."" but it's like your body is on autopilot and filling your plate/ordering UberEats anyway.  Your body is doing this because it that massive binge is going to flood you with dopamine.  And after you eat, you're like, ""Why the eff did I just do that?  What's wrong with me?""  You have those thoughts because you're brain is at normal/high levels of dopamine and able to think like a normal person again (for the time being).

Now, **this medicine doesn't REMOVE your appetite itself.  It's not an appetite killer.**  All this medicine does is bring your dopamine levels to the baseline normal level.  Like a normal brain.  And suddenly, I found... I barely ate.  I just...  wasn't hungry.  I stopped thinking about food.  I would make breakfast, bring the plate to my room, and NORMALLY I would eat it right away and then start work.  But now, the plate of food will sit on my desk for hours before I remember it's there.  And I'll finally see it at 3pm and be like, ""Oh yeah.  I gotta eat that.""

And you know how 'normal' people stop when they're full?  Like if they have 3 bites left, they'll refuse to eat it.  And us BED people roll our eyes at them (internally) and think, ""Ugh, so wasteful, just eat it damn, it's not gonna kill you.""  Well... I learned normal people CANNOT force themselves to eat when they do not want to eat.  I had 3 bites of toast left over once.  And forcing myself to eat it felt like I was eating cardboard.  No taste, no pleasure, I was literally just stuffing cotton in my mouth and swallowing.  That's what it felt like.

Now... how come I lost SO much weight in May?  Because I barely ate...  I just didn't feel like it.  I didn't need the dopamine.  This SUPER strong effect only lasted 1 month though, because the medicine was so new to my system.  I even started off on a low dose.  The effective dose is 50-70mg, but my doc started me off on 30mg.  Your body gets used to it and the effect wears off a bit.

So in June, I found, if there was super yummy food in the kitchen, I could eat it for breakfast and towards the end of the day, when the medicine was wearing off.  So I upped my dose to 50mg.  It was a little more effective, but more or less, I could still eat junk food if I wanted.

But the binges were WAY less frequent, my binges were way smaller, and now I naturally even take smaller portions of my normal meals.

But you can't be on this medicine forever.  This medicine is not for weight loss.  And using it JUST to lose weight quickly is considered abuse of the drug.  I want to heal my BED, right?  I want to fix my mental disorder, so this is my treatment (alongside Vyvanse):

* eat a meal/snack every 3 hours (I'll explain why the doc said this is so important)
* make sure EVERYTIME I eat, that meal/snack has 3 out of 4 food groups.  EVERYTIME.
* DO NOT restrict yourself from anything.  Restriction creates feelings of deprivation which contributes to binge urges
* DO CBT everyday.  Even for 5 min in the morning.  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is like a self-therapy manual where you assess your own triggers and make your own redirects to fight those triggers (that's just one small part of CBT).  You can find free guides online which focus on BED.  [Here is the one I use.](https://www.naadac.org/assets/2416/mitchell-cbt-for-bed-self-help-manual.pdf)  Also, you don't have to implement of those 'redirects' to your triggers, or make any huge changes in your life.  CBT helps me just by making me assess my own behaviour/patterns.  I learn about them, and then just sit with that knowledge in my brain.  It helps.  Just a couple of min per day helps me.
* Do not calorie count/intermittent fast/starve yourself/diet in any way.  We're trying to normalize our eating pattern in our brain.  So this is not the time to diet.
* Eat (the way I described in the beginning) EVEN if you don't feel like eating.

So my doctor said BED people have 2 problems.  1)  they have BED.  2)  they're normally overweight.

She said, you can only treat 1 problem at a time.  You cannot diet and lose weight, and treat BED.  Because dieting is about restriction/calorie counting/etc.  Our BED cannot heal if dieting/restriction is in the picture.  FIRST we have to treat BED, then you can lose weight healthily later on.

The reason why you should eat 3 out of the 4 food groups EVERY single meal/snack, is to ensure your body is satisfied.  Eating an apple alone may not be satisfying enough.  But eating an apple with 1 tbsp of peanut butter on melba toast (fruit, protein, grain), is required for the treatment.  Your body is getting a variety of food in that one snack, variety of nutrition, and flavours.  So there's no feeling of deprivation whatsoever and your risk of binging goes way down.  If you stick to a regimenting schedule, your body won't chemically urge you to binge.  Also, you don't have to cut any junkfood/bad food.  Include that in your snacks/meals, but make sure you count the food groups correctly.  A snack might be a bowl of Lays chips, 1 glass of soymilk, and a couple of crackers (veg, protein, carb).  Sounds dumb, but you have to hit 3/4 food groups every time you eat.  And you'll see that you WON'T finish an entire bag of Lays chips in one shot because...  well you're kind full from before...  and you just forced yourself to eat crackers and drink a glass of soymilk... and well...  you don't really want more Lays right now.  It's crazy.  I know.  Trust me.  This is how normal people live.

**The purpose of Vyvanse is to regulate your dopamine FOR YOU temporarily, so you can create a structured eating schedule and do your CBT self-therapy without having to struggle with the mental turmoil/sense of failure/emotional rollercoaster that binges cause.  It pauses your BED for a short while to allow you to train yourself how to eat in such a way that prevents BED binges.**

BED recovery is a long road.  Definitely more than a few months.  For me, it may take a year or more to train myself to eat this way.  Vyvanse is not part of the long-term recovery.  It's like an emergency treatment for a few months to help you get started, and then you gotta continue on your own.

I'm sorry for writing this whole long thing.  I just get really excited when I see people talk about BED because it's so new, and I feel in control and self-assured for the first time in my life.

I'm a 30 year old woman who has struggled with weight since literally grade 4.  That's the first time I realized I was fat.  I've done all the diets, I am a runner, I've honestly tried everything but I could never manage to reach a healthy weight because I couldn't control my eating long-term.  I always thought, ""What's wrong with me?  How do these people start calorie counting and boom, 3 months later, they reached their goal?  I know how to calorie count.  Why can't I just stick with it?""  So I thought I was undisciplined, lazy, lacked willpower, and was mentally a weak person.  Because I literally couldn't control something SO simple.  I couldn't eat less/better.

My doc said everything I was doing my whole life was LITERALLY making my BED worse.  Diets/restrictions/calorie counting/over exercising to 'burn off' calories...  that all creates feelings of deprivation, which leads to binges.  My whole life I've been doing the OPPOSITE of what I was supposed to be doing.

Got married in 2018.  Was 221 lbs, my heaviest, at 5'5.  Hate all my wedding photos.

Lost 15 lbs in 2019 through cycles of starvation/binges/etc.

Lost 35-40 lbs in 2020 since May, **thanks to proper treatment of my BED**.  I'm now 167lbs.  Holy fucking cow.  Have another 25lbs to go but I'm doing it slowly.  5 lbs per month.  Treating my BED as the priority and not really trying to aggressively lose weight.  I wish, I wish, I wish science had formally recognized BED and Vyvanse use when I was a teen.  My entire life would have been so different.  Not filled with anxiety, shyness, refusal to participate in anything, dressing in baggy clothes.  I would have lived a normal life.

But hey, at least this is happening when I'm 30 and not 50.  It could be worse :)

So yeah, that's the reason for this long ass post.  I learned about BED and Vyvanse from a post on Reddit actually, a user said it changed her life.  Wish I could find that post and thank that OP because her post changed my life.  So I feel compelled to share my story here whenever I see people talking about BED.

* I felt like garbage any time I trained
* My energy levels were inconsistent

Point two is probably one of the biggest issues with fasted training, in my opinion. We all know diet is key to weight loss. Training really is meant to get your activity level up and, if you're smart about it, to achieve performance goals in some other discipline. When you're fasted, you can't perform at your highest, so you are leaving gains on the table. This both means your workout is going to be sub-par and your probably going to be less active throughout the day since your energy is shot, so you miss out on both desired effects of training.",1lw9wsj,n2d5vyn,2025-07-10 14:01:46

What’s one “healthy” habit you realized was secretly sabotaging your weight loss?,"There are some cases where if you move enough you CAN up your intake a bit. For example if I went on a 1.5h jog I would burn approximately 950kcal on that run. Eating 1200kcal on that day is just not feasible and would end with me being so hangry I would binge. 
So on very high ""calories out"" day I do up my intake by approximately half of the calories the apps and calculators tell me I have burned. To stick with that previous example I would eat around 400kcal more and end my day eating 1600 kcal as my base is also 1200.",1lw9wsj,n2cgpy9,2025-07-10 11:35:40

Some ppl are very hard core about not eating workout calories back, but so long as you aren’t assuming the watch is completely accurate and eating back loads of calories, sometimes your body needs a bit more after working out. If having 200 extra calories now when you burned 500 will keep you from binging later, then the 200 calories now is a good idea. Nothing works perfectly for everyone. Each person is different, and that’s okay. ",1lw9wsj,n2cwrkr,2025-07-10 13:14:20

What’s one “healthy” habit you realized was secretly sabotaging your weight loss?,"That’s safe as the fitness calorie estimates, from machines to apps to watches to calculators,  almost always *also* include a generic BMR estimate in their calories burned totals. I’ve been tearing my hair out for years trying to find one that doesn’t, and it’s basically impossible. Anything that asks your gender, height weight and/or age is doing a BMR estimate.

And the calories burned totals rarely if ever show they’re including the BMR for the time spent exercising, which makes it easy for everyone to accidentally double count, and is just plain confusing. 

So for your example, say, if your apps/devices say you burned 950kcal running for 1.5h, they are **including** the 75 calories you’d normally burn in 1.5h (from your 1200 base). This means you either need to mentally subtract 75kcal from your 950kcal running, or from your 1200 base. Otherwise you’re double counting the 75kcal.

It’s not a huge difference unless you’re working out for hours, but it is definitely enough to mess up anyone who is new, obsessively calorie counting and exercising for weight loss, overestimating their BMR, or just took a really long walk. I truly don’t understand why this is the norm, as most people think just like you wrote in your comment:  # kcal base + # calories burned during exercise = calories I have burned today.",1lw9wsj,n2clo74,2025-07-10 12:08:45

Being fat ruined my life,I was 44 5’3 and 275 pounds. I was trying to get bypass surgery but lost too much weight for it. The dietician was great I even had a therapist help me work through my binging problems. I’d encourage you to see a general practitioner for a physical. Ask for help with weight loss you don’t need meds or surgery maybe you can get a dietician and /or therapy to help. There is ways to change. I was where you are now. I have a fiance but was amazed he was attracted to me at all. It was hard to quit binging. I cut out some foods I stay away from baked goods and most frozen quick meals. When I have a snack I have a serving or less and just one a day. I lowered my portion sizes as well. I’ve been doing high protein low carb and sugar this whole time. I’m 46 now and did my weekly weigh today and am 165. It’s possible to do this there are a lot of options.

Being fat ruined my life,"as a kid I had a terrible binge eating disorder for as long as I could remember and physicly did not know what an appetite was and had to eat everything I saw like a greedy pig. I was skinny as a twig as well because my metabolism ate through it like a horse, but that changed in my mid teens and I stoped being so twiggy. No one flagged my eating as a problem because I was always such a malnurished looking girl, until I stopped looking like that and more like a 5' 1"" 170lbs marshmallow while excercising 3 hours every day.
 I was very lucky for getting diagnosed with ADD only 2 years later and getting on some medication that made me want to vomit at the sight of food which was completly forign to me. I was loosing 7 lbs a week and got down to a sickly 115 lbs before I figured out how to force myself to eat again. 
Ive been off that medicine for a few years now and was really worried that I would go back to my old ways, but the experience really taught me that being full did not mean my stomach had to hurt and how much food someone my size should really be eating, not too much and not too little. I have a lot of muscle now, grew a couple inches, and now I have the most attractive and idealized body I always wished for myself for forever at 145 lbs. 
If you go down the route of medication, use it as a learning tool, not a crutch. only plan to use it for a set amount of time and absorbe as much information about yourself as you can during that time. when I originally was gaining weight, I noted that I felt really good at 145, when I lost it again I noticed the same thing, and now that is where I feel amazing still. I am not tired from having to much weight to move around or too little mass to move around with.

I’m sad your group has shrunk, but do believe it will bounce back. 

Requiring you to provide an extra feast for 8 for one diner every round when Melissa shows up is too much. That you offered double the amount at no extra cost says to me that you earnestly meant to meet equitably & heal the conflict, whereas Polly & Melissa sought to leverage your apology into an endless penitence & manipulate a forced acquiescence to their demands (which, btw, should be noted wasn’t at all warned of ahead of time by Polly, so she made a lot of assumptions & impositions in seeking to please her partner). 

It seems clear that P&M are just dead set on getting only their way no matter how much it discomfits or imposes on the rest of the group. That’s certainly not in the congenial, inclusive spirit of the group you have nurtured.

You all did.

> and be in a group where she can eat the way she does without judgment.

So she wants to stuff her face without judgement. And hey, if _she'd_ made the food, or brought extra for herself, you probably would have. The problem wasn't 'you didn't let her eat as she wished without judgement', the problem was 'she was rude, made assumptions, and behaved in an entitled manner'. 

She _must_ know how expensive it is to feed her. So why should the cooks be forced to bear the brunt of the cost? Yes, your friends all contribute, but you said you've been thinking of upping the amount because life is expensive now, and if you were to up the price so that you could afford enough to feed her, why the hell should everyone else have to pay?

I had a friend who was pretty big. We'd go to dinner and he'd have 3 times as much food as the rest of us. But none of us cared, because _he paid for his own food_ and none of us were forced to go with less or none at all. Nor would he have taken everything on the table had we decided to do a share.

We skipped this month's party because of all the drama. Next month, I will do a roast dinner.  Usually I like to serve numerous courses, but roast dinner kind of works better when it's served together, so the only starter will be a simple consomme or, if I have slightly wilting veggies, a pureed vegetable soup. I make consomme a few times a year and pressure-can it (I love to do everything possible from scratch), and it makes it easier for dealing with my parents' diabetes because I know what's in everything. I buy my meat from a local butcher who only works with a handful of farms that practise humane livestock raising, so I can custom-order the cuts I want. Yes, I know this is privilege because my family can afford it. We aren't taking European vacations or anything, but the food is good and we have a cleaner once a week.  I'd be living on rice and beans if I had to buy my own food.  
  
Two days before the meal, I'll stud the beef roast with rosemary and garlic and the pork with sprigs of thyme and thin slices of onion. I rub some sea salt, white pepper and garlic powder on the beef and sea salt, white pepper and sage powder on the pork. Let those sit, wrapped tightly in plastic, in the fridge, for two days before roasting. Just before roasting, I'll stud the pork with thin slices of apple (slide those in beside the onion). I'll put apple juice in with the pork and red wine in with the beef. During roasting, I turn each roast several times so all sides have a chance to sit in the liquid. I favour lean meats with little marbling, so I have to make extra effort to ensure they're moist and tender.  
  
After the roasting, I'll make two different gravies, a beef one and a pork one. There will also be Yorkshire pudding, roasted carrots, applesauce, and a bacon/apple/brussel sprout dish. Roast dinner doesn't really serve well in courses, so we'll have a simple consomme soup starter and then straight to the main course, which we will likely eat very slowly. I keep the serving dishes covered so the food stays hot.   
  
Then a break where everyone who is able helps clean up, and then we sit around and listen to music and chat, and eventually dessert, which will be sticky toffee pudding with whisky sauce and whipped cream.

If I do it right, I'll have leftover everything. Then the next day, my mother will make fried potato cakes for breakfast (parents get up earlier than me). And she'll eat the brussel sprouts during the day because she loves them. For supper, I'll chop the leftover meat and carrots and add some peas to make a simple stew (the gravies mix nicely) and my family will eat that with bread.

Sorry if that's more info than you wanted, but I hate food waste so I wanted to show how I cook deliberately to prevent it. There's a cookbook called More with Less that is really good for showing cheap, healthy ways to cook that also avoid waste.",1ixi4ix,men81r4,2025-02-25 03:49:56

If the latter, it’s interesting to me that she’s then seemingly flipped to the other side even though she witnessed how difficult & health-impacting your journey was. 

What I’m asking, I guess, is if Polly seems to enjoy the dominant role of enabling, which can definitely have an inclusive/accepting aspect but which also tends to cement the dependency of the feedee upon the enabler.

Tell them you will accept them **but** they make up the cost of the food required. 

If you are doing restaurant style cooking and plating, and they are paying only $35, you should do a full fruit and vegetable, only dinner. No expensive proteins or such. 

I know plenty of large eaters who are yet to fully control themselves, have decided to go the fruit and vegetable route. And while they still eat an enormous amount, it has changed them in other ways. 

If they want the 14 layer lasagne, or the twice baked chicken, or the 8 ways cooked steak.... and have the portions of at least 8 people, then **THEY** pay the difference. **You are not fat shaming at all. You are money shaming them.**

**They can't afford to eat on $35 a fancy meal, so they take other people's $35 portions. They need to pay the $210 for theirs and the other 5 person's portions they want.**",1ixi4ix,mencqa0,2025-02-25 04:20:11

I apologized and replaced them once it sunk in what I'd done, and she just hugged me and said it was okay; she knew things were hard for me. For years, Polly gave me an acceptance I needed, and when I was ready to face my addiction and fight it, she was at my side all the way. I don't understand who she's become with Melissa. I mean, Polly has issues of her own; she isn't a saint, but I never doubted her care for my well-being before now.

Hopefully Final Update on Am I the Asshole if I Don't Serve as Much Food as My Guests Want?,"I mean, let's be real though, saying it's like a live mukbang show is actually pretty tame. A lot of the mukbang performers (I think that's what you'd call them?) are actually quite thin, so there's really no correlation to mukbang and being obese. Honestly, eating what is essentially a full tray of lasagna would very much *be* considered a mukbang if you were recording the consumption of said meal. 

All that aside, it's not cruel to use a metaphor to explain something out of the ordinary when you're trying to give people an idea of what happened. I get that it *could* be considered fat-shaming, but I do believe there's a huge difference between being malicious (as in, literally just shaming someone for existing while being fat) versus using a metaphor to help people visualize a story through text. She could weigh 100lbs, and eating that much lasagna in one sitting would *still* read like a mukbang. 

I feel like sometimes people decide to get offended on the behalf of others just to feel righteous, and honestly, that never helps. I'm sure Melissa was offended and slightly embarrassed, but sometimes, being called out on unacceptable behaviours, even *if* they *do* embarrass us, helps us grow as people and learn to act more aware and socially literate (and I say this as someone who is autistic with ADHD, so I get messing up social situations sometimes) especially when it comes to something like *sharing* a meal with friends.

I *do* feel a bit sorry that Melissa feels as though she has to be allowed to eat in excess in order to feel accepted by a group of friends, but you gave the perfect answer. It would be one thing if it was a medical condition that made it very hard to lose weight, but to willingly eat in such excess, to the point it can *severely* shorten your lifespan, is just dangerous, and *real* friends wouldn't allow you to make yourself sick just because that is what you'd prefer. I get it - food is delicious! I married a chef, and I am one of those people who can't even eat as much as I'd like to from a normal sized portion, but still holds weight from hormonal issues, and it especially sucks when you're around such amazing food all the time but you can hardly enjoy it when it's fresh. I wish all the time that this stubborn weight actually had an actual cause, because then at least I'd be enjoying amazing food, haha. If I could stomach a full portion, I'd be thrilled! If I could go for seconds of some of my favourite things!? I'd have a damn celebration, haha. But I know for a fact, food can be just like any addiction, so you need to be careful, because just like any other addiction...it could really kill you.

Unhinged advice on how to stop binge eating,"My advice -

First, eat as much as you want, 6 times a day (3 meals, 3 snacks, 3 hrs apart) but limit yourself to ""whole foods"" and make each meal/snack about 30% animal protein (shrimp, steak, chicken breast, cottage cheese, yogurt) 30% non-animal fat (ex: avocado, almond butter), and 30% healthy carbs (ex: potato, quinoa, brown rice, fruits, vegetables)... You'll be getting plenty of fiber too, if you eat like this. 

Do this for 3 months, while you simultaneously start going to the YMCA 3-5 days a week for *swimming, hot tub, and sauna only* (easy, rewarding, heals body pain)

Month 4 - change nothing except now you weigh and record every single thing you eat (including eating out). Weigh yourself daily starting here

Month 5 - start a new diet plan based off of the mostly whole food diet you've been eating, but reducing your caloric intake by 250 calories a day (and eat out one day a week less if you're still struggling with that)

Also during month 5 - start burning 250 calories by intentional walking on a treadmill or elliptical each day

Spend the next 3 months building this routine - 250 cal deficit on a healthy diet, 250 calories burned from walking each day

You'll lose between 1-3 lbs a month, but more importantly, you're building good habits and giving your body time to re-learn appropriate hunger cues

Eventually you'll plateu, and you can reduce by another 1 or 200 calories, and add strength training with weights into your routine 3 times a week 

If eating is an addiction for you, you *have* to replace it with something else that creates dopamine. Maybe knitting. Maybe some form of exercise outside of the walking. For me, the sauna and hot tub have been replacements for drinking...

It's a long process. You gotta figure out all of your triggers and redirect them in a healthy way (eat out at restaurants with friends a lot? Find some finds who want to hike instead, etc)

Don't give up. Losing weight is one thing. Beating the addiction is another. Focus on harm reduction rather than perfection, and be *PATIENT*

You're looking at a 2+ year process at a minimum",1lbvhwo,mxxk78l,2025-06-15 16:33:34

Not medical advice, just personal experience:

The only thing that's ever fully worked for me is adding meds. Vyvanse is on-label for both ADHD and Binge Eating Disorder. I use ozempic/wegovy which, while not on label for BED (but on-label for obesity) seems to help me and other bingers quite a lot.

Edit: also, in the context of BED, tracking calories and other weight loss strategies are absolutely NOT necessarily harmless and should only be done under professional advice/supervision. For many people (myself included) calorie counting only amplified my obsessive thoughts about food and diet and made it more tempting to eat all the time. Attempting to lose weight while attempting to newly get BED under control, in itself, may be a contradictory set of goals. A lot of what helped me (greatly aided by medication that quiets my hunger and obsessive food drive) was stopping counting calories, no more food scale, no ""I need to order the healthiest thing in the restaurant!"" no good food/bad food moral judgments, no forbidden temptations. Just really working on letting go of the preoccupation with and anxiety about food that I felt. I eat when I'm hungry, don't eat distracted, stop eating when I feel slightly full with the promise I can come back later and eat more if I need to- and I usually don't.",15fobqo,jue9d5u,2023-08-01 21:05:21

Change all the  debit and credit card numbers so she stops ordering food. Don’t allow enablers who would bring her junk food to come around.

Only keep healthy high protein options in the house. She isn’t doing the shopping so she has no say.

Don’t allow your children to become her care givers in their preteens (memories or having to clean my mom up and having to change the wraps on her legs haunt me and my brothers)

Have a real talk about her having to live in a facility if she doesn’t make some serious changes. 

I will say, none of this worked for my mom. My mom died a year ago at well over 600 pounds. Food addiction is real.  She was working up until a fall left her bed bound and then once she couldn’t walk she ended up in a nursing facility. The sad part is her dad was that weight and a few aunts and uncles are close or right behind. By the time my mom was willing to try gastric bypass she wasn’t a candidate.

My mom was hospitalized at one point because she had a damn feeding tube and wouldn’t stop eating. It was really sad. She signed a piece of paper saying she understood the risk and released the nursing home of liability because she was on a liquid diet for tube feeding, but she kept ordering door dash in the nursing home. When she didn’t have access to credit or debit cards, she would barter or sell her stuff to others in the nursing home in order to get cash to give to others to order her food.  She started paying someone to buy ingredients to make her food and she’d have it in her mini fridge. Ended up with botulism then sepsis. All over damn food.

The reality is, unless she can get her own food, you’ve got some control here. Is she orders it to be delivered, she can’t have it if she can’t get up and get it, otherwise she eats what you put in front of her. My mom died young for no other reason than she couldn’t stop eating. And what’s crazy is my mom didn’t get to her worst until she was in her 50s when it was harder to move the weight around, she worked a full time job at over 500 pounds at a store, 40 hours a week. Even then she was on the fast track to an early grave. But she always said she was working full time so no one could say anything about her being fat and lazy, and that her dad was that weight.

Put your foot down. Therapy, effort and being responsible for her addiction is all part of the conversation. She's got to die if she keeps it up. Ask her point blank of she wants her kids finding her dead from eating one day in the near future. That's what's gonna happen. Maybe since she cannot do her own care she needs a facility to help her get herself under control. Honestly the 20 lbs lost isn't that impressive and probably shows she was overeating even with the meds. She needs help beyond what you can provide.

It’s not about her looks. She is slowly killing herself. What if something happened to you, how would she be able to take care of your kids.

You should focus on the fact that your marriage is no longer a partnership - your partner is not doing her part.

>How can I get one of her diet attempts to stick while we wait for another opportunity to get on drugs?

Again, don’t focus on her diet. Focus on your partnership. You can tell her that if it continues to not be a partnership you’re going to end it because you want a partner. Now, how much time should you wait for after telling her this? I have no idea. You’ll have to decide it yourself because there is no “scientific” way to ascertain the right amount of time.

>I need a plan and an end in sight

It’s impossible to guarantee the success of a plan, even if you get to the point of making one. For example, every week she plans to turn her life around and then fails. So be prepared for the worst case scenario.",1jcsizd,mi5657w,2025-03-16 20:03:49

You have to have that coming to Jesus talk with her and let her know things have to change. Her eating habits must change. Glp 1s are nice but ultimately pointless unless she’s going to stay on them forever.

How can I help her see I'm serious and salvage this?","I've been 550+lbs (268kg) at my heaviest.  I know exactly what it feels like to be the unhealthy partner,  and a mother that cannot function effectively due to the immense impact such a large weight has on physical and mental health,  as well as social and professional connections. 

You're in a terrible position because there are many layers to what you're experiencing.  

You're basically functioning as a single parent as well as a carer. 

You're also a financial provider and executive assistant in the home. 

You're human and you're own person,  but you're also part of a romantic couple that is meant to be a partnership. 

Your social life as an independent human,  as a couple,  and as a parent is deeply impacted.  

I can absolutely see why you're at breaking point.  This is far too much for one human to handle for any length of time.  You should be extremely proud of yourself for getting as far as you have and still wanting to help your wife.  

But I'm going to be very honest with you.  

You are drowning.  

You have financial instability due to current work status.  

You have children that need to be taken care of as a priority. 

You need to put your oxygen mask on first.  The children need to have a stable home,  stable resources,  and at least one effective,  engaged,  and loving parent.  

You cannot save her from herself.  I say this as someone who could not be saved.  This is an extended,  extreme situation that you've tried to address repeatedly and you now are at breaking point.  Your energy must be spent on the children and on yourself *first.*

You cannot save everyone under the current circumstances. The second your wife decides she wants to be part of a solution,  part of the future of the family, that's when you work *together* to find solutions and overcome barriers to help get help and be supported. 

You need to focus on therapy for yourself,  look into enablement, and decide what your own future and the children's future needs to look like first.  Ideally,  your wife will be included and will take the steps to work on her ability to be part of the family and be a responsible parent.  

I'm 42F and my daughter is about to turn 21. She's thriving, and she must take credit because I absolutely failed her in terms of being physically present,  social with her circle,  attending school events,  having fun and sharing the world with her for almost a decade.  I totally and utterly fucked up and am living with that legacy of our relationship and my current health.

Worst, I let my partner and daughter live in fear that I would die from my morbid obesity and my resulting physical and mental health conditions.   It is my single biggest regret of my entire life.  

Others here may help you with ideas to support her - I hope that what I've said will help reframe your role in this.    

She must save herself,  that's a decision she must make.  There is nothing you can do to make that decision for her.  You can support her and have that discussion with her,  and stop buying her food.  Let her get upset.  Let her get her own food.  Serve food that is nourishing for your family.  

Therapy,  no further enabling (once you have therapy), help from therapist to have that heavy conversation with her,  and first and foremost protect yourself and your children so that they have a stable life where their own needs are met.

How can I help her see I'm serious and salvage this?","You really hit the nail on the head with ‘the extra things you need to do because of it.’ She definitely needs to be back in therapy, NON NEGOTIABLE, because food addiction and or depression are legitimate illnesses that require professional help. The odds of her success without therapy are low. It’s ok for a relationship to end and flow, and sometimes with a disability or disease there is an unbalanced dynamic. But she is capable of so much more and her ‘disease’ can be treated and cured with the right help and effort on her part. It’s time for her to show up in your relationship and put in the equal work to participate and take the burden off of you.

Ask her current therapist or her PCP/GP for referrals and suggestions. Binge eating is an addiction and she will need a ton of willpower to overcome the urges long-term. She needs to treat her depression. not to numb her feelings with food and generally re-learn her relationship with food.

While she can't do a glp-1 inhibitor at this time, there are often medical programs for losing weight, including pills that can be taken orally. They're not long-term solutions, she absolutely needs to curb the overarching issues, but targeted therapy is the place to start.

Since you state that you recently lost your job, you *could* phrase the lack of allowing any ""extra"" high calorie foods and simply cost saving at the moment. The fallout probably won't be fun for anyone, but this way you may avoid the reaction from her about fat shaming if it's presented as simple economics.

A necessity for you is that she becomes functional, it’s not fair for so much to be put on you. You’re trying to help and be supportive but that’s clearly gone far enough.
Your kids need her in their life, so her health is a necessity. Do not enable her.

Explain to her calmly, that she can choose to do what she has to do to get what she wants at the store, but since you’re the one quite literally doing ALL the heavy lifting, you will be crafting the healthy meals and portions. If she doesn’t like it, she has the choice to physically do something about it. Explain it to her like you would a child you are trying to teach accountability to, in a way that does not shame them, and contains no emotion. You’re not angry and you’re not indifferent. You’re staying differentiated. (Look up Psychology in Seattle, Dr. Kirk Honda does a wonderful job of explaining differentiation). To simplify, how would Spock set this boundary with her? Just be calm and logical and Spockify your emotions. 

You also need to set the need that she STAY in therapy. This is clearly tied to emotions and she’s not going to find her way out of these unhealthy behaviors without help. Speaking of, you should seek a therapist yourself. This is not an easy situation and you need help with it as well. Exploring the why’s and how’s of you enabling her is also important. You need to also look into couples therapy, and honestly, it’s hard to say which should happen first, couples or individual. Concurrently would be best but clearly it’s going to be tough getting her to stick to therapy, so you do what you can.

How can I help her see I'm serious and salvage this?","I also had the gastric sleeve,  and a medical grade zip tie called the minimiser ring (not lapband). It did not work,  and despite me only having a tiny stomach I still managed to stay the same weight. I didn't lose a single lbs/kg. 

My intense childhood trauma created negative coping strategies around food and shame that needed more than surgical and clinical intervention. When I say I tried EVERYTHING I mean it: I lived in hospitals for months at a time,  the surgeries, naltrexone (originally for heroin addiction that was shown to be effective for food addiction), every diet, every type of weight loss drug, all the exercise,  all the specialists.  I spent over 20 years battling obesity,  but the last 10 was when I couldn't function anymore.  

My daughter said no one has ever tried harder than you.  I cried because it at least validated that I had tried so so hard, despite not succeeding.  

Nothing worked because I hadn't made the conscious and consistent choice to keep going no matter what.  I'm still on my health journey,  and it's taken many years,  many diagnoses and many, many trials and errors for me to learn that every person is different in what works for them in terms of the biological mechanism of weight loss, and the mental health work that is required is nuanced for every person.  

The only commonality between us all is that we need to make that conscious and consistent choice to keep going.  No one can do that on our behalf.  

As a mother to a daughter - your mother lived in a special hell, where it originated was not her fault,  but where it kept going was a hell of her own making. You were caught in that hell with her and were cheated of something sacred. The safety and unconditional love of a mother that you very much deserved.  We are both examples of what happens when pain isn't contained or addressed within ourselves,  and you (and my daughter) were innocent parties in the slowest of suicides. You deserved better,  my daughter deserved better,  and it's unfair that you didn't get to feel that sense of love and safety.  I know my daughter is very angry at me and hurt by me and disappointed in me. I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make her feel safer,  but I know that's something I cannot fix.  It has created an empathy and kindness in her that flows on to everyone else,  and for that I'm grateful despite what it cost her.",1jcsizd,midb5fp,2025-03-18 02:01:51

You get a dopamine hit from it just like you do with many other things. 

Many people think eating disorders only include anorexia and bulemia, but overeating or very restrictive eating can also be eating disorders. 

There are medications that cause a ton of weight gain, but I don’t think there are any that can cause someone to be a minimum of 300 lbs overweight. There are healthy women out there who weigh 200 lbs, not a ton, but they exist and that’s why I am only saying 300 lbs overweight. 

I feel for OP, his wife and their kids. As it is, the stress on her internal organs likely means she won’t make it to 50. She will live longer if she loses the weight, but I bet there’s some irreparable damage to her organs already that means even with weight loss, she’ll still have taken several years off her lifespan.",1jcsizd,mi82jgh,2025-03-17 07:25:03

I am someone who overcame binge eating disorder after a decade of struggle—AMA,"I’m so glad you’ve decided to seek therapy—it can be incredibly difficult to navigate on your own. Personally, I worked with a registered counselor who specialized in eating disorders. I started with one therapist who helped me build my self-esteem and used trauma resolution techniques, but she had to retire from the trade due to burnout. Since 2020, I’ve been with my current counselor, who focuses on reframing. This approach involved sharing my beliefs about my body and food, and she would ask insightful questions that helped me reframe those dysfunctional thoughts. Before I could truly work on the behavioral issues driving my binge eating, I had to educate myself on the social pressures of body image and how those external influences shaped my own perceptions. Therapy is definitely a long journey—it took me about three years to reduce my binges from daily to just a few times a year. I didn’t feel fully recovered until I read a few books that really solidified everything for me.",1iwjxjf,mees0d4,2025-02-23 21:28:18

What I'm trying to say is that you did an amazing job recognizing the foods and staying away from them. But also, it's not your fault that you over eat those foods. They are designed for you to.

It is amazing how strong the desire to stress eat is,"This definitely registers as someone who has binged since childhood.

For me, stress eating caused my weight to yo-yo over the years, but what led to me becoming overweight was the mindset that I spent all day taking care of everyone else, so I *deserve* this treat. I had to really shift my idea of what I deserve (health, happiness, feeling comfortable in my own skin), as well as be more assertive in my day-to-day life and carve out time for myself so I didn't feel resentful or helpless.",mgedt1,gssosm2,2021-03-30 13:10:44
It is amazing how strong the desire to stress eat is,"Damn this hit close to home. And not just stress-eating, but also happy-eating. I guess it's just eating when your nervous at all, either because something unexpectedly good happened or something that was downright awful happened, either way it would usually throw my food-tracking out of whack :(

I eventually got it under control by finding something cathartic for me to do instead, which turned out to be watching horror movies or horror gameplay while exercising. I like watching stuff with other people, but horror is one genre that nobody I know well seems to like, so doing it while exercising was a great way to get two birds with one stone. Also, when I get jumpscared my biking intensity goes higher. It's a great way to let off Steam and switch off while doing something healthy for my body and also working through my ginormous backlog of horror games and movies to peruse.",mgedt1,gssq7ro,2021-03-30 13:23:36
It is amazing how strong the desire to stress eat is,"Oh I understand that feeling so well. I have a fast paced and somewhat stressful job and two children, and oftentimes at the end of the day I’ve felt so stressed that I just want to bury myself in donuts and chips. I’ve been doing the things I’ve been doing to lose weight for about 3 months, and I’ve really tried to curb those cravings for emotional comfort from food because they are the reason I’m in this mess. Like you said, it never makes you feel better long term!",mgedt1,gssnbau,2021-03-30 12:56:32
It is amazing how strong the desire to stress eat is,"I feel that. I had a rough day at work last week and getting home took twice as long as it should have because of broken traffic lights and a couple of accidents, and I needed to go to the grocery store to get things for dinner on the way home. I bought a bag of M&Ms because they were on an end cap and I knew eating chocolate would help me feel better. It occurred to me that, a year ago, in the same situation, I would have bought the M&Ms but also a package of cookies, a bag of chips, a box of Cheez-Its, some pudding, and maybe a carton of ice cream. Last week, I just bought the M&Ms. I ate a couple handfuls once I got home. A year ago, I would have eaten the entire ""sharing-size"" bag in the car on the 5-minute drive home and hidden the evidence in the trash can outside.

When I started trying to lose weight this time around, I made a conscious effort to fix my relationship with food. I did a lot more introspection on *why* I wanted to eat when I did. Was I bored? Was I stressed? Was my stomach growling because it just finished digesting a carb-heavy meal? Was I lethargic? Was I genuinely hungry? And then I thought about how the food I was about to eat would nourish me. Was it giving me protein to sustain my muscle mass for my workouts? Was it giving me fat to keep me satiated until my next meal? Was it giving me carbs to boost my energy? Was it just something that tasted good to make me feel happy?

The kicker, though, was that I didn't let myself feel guilty for making ""bad"" choices. I just acknowledged the reasoning why. Simply being more conscious about what I was eating and why helped break that cycle of stress -> eat -> guilt -> eat more.",mgedt1,gsst6mh,2021-03-30 13:49:23
It is amazing how strong the desire to stress eat is,"I feel this and I’ve been doing better with this for a couple of reasons. First, when I don’t get enough protein during the day, I almost can’t help but feel like bingeing at the end of the day. If you struggle with evening snacking, you’ve got to seriously examine your protein situation throughout the day and that alone might be enough to curb it. Like 15 - 20 grams per meal seems to be adequate.

Second is that I PLAN to eat wtf I want after dinner and before bed and it’s my little ritual. Around 7:30-8, I make a cup of herbal tea, I get out a little plate and arrange a few desserts on it (I’m at a tiny deficit at 2,000 calories, so I reserve 400 of that for this. Think 10-20% of your total budget). That way if I don’t want all of it, my deficit is bigger that day. This thing with the tea and the plate is a game changer - I’m not an out of control crazy person attacking a bag of chips in a dark kitchen, I’m a grown woman enjoying a dignified assortment of delicacies 

BTW, The tiny deficit thing is the best choice I ever made to help feelings of deprivation and binges. 2,000 is maybe - *maybe* 200 calories below maintenance for me, maybe closer to 150. Even if I eat every single calorie, I’m still moving in the right direction. I feel good all day, I never feel that hungry except sometimes a little right before bed, and I’m basically already eating at maintenance so I don’t have to worry about regain the same way I have in the past. When I reach my goal, I will still be eating this way, I’ll just be able to have a bit more Mayo or whatever.",mgedt1,gsssnfh,2021-03-30 13:44:46

This time around, I let myself eat around a 250-cal daily deficit, I focused on weekly averages instead of daily numbers, and I made a rule not to eat below my BMR, even on sedentary days. If I wanted a bigger deficit, I needed to get off my ass and do some exercise, even if it just meant walking a few laps of my street after dinner.",mgedt1,gssw18h,2021-03-30 14:13:13

Stress eating anyone?,"I struggle with this too. Usually my mentality goes, “It’s been stressful and I’ve worked hard or put up with enough BS that at the end of the day, I deserve a shit ton of ice cream.” 

The issue is not that I need to unwind, but that *food* is the way I reward myself—and this is common for lots of us, and it’s partially ingrained when we’re kids and our parents let us get a candy bar for behaving at the grocery store. We learn early on that food is a reward for good behavior. 

What I’m trying to do is make other things a reward, especially a fitness-related one. On a day I want to eat all the dessert, I decide to reward myself instead with a new lip balm or something else small, or I can give myself a “point”. I can then get new workout leggings/bra/shirt when I get to 5 points (or 10, or whatever is reasonable for the cost of the item). It is delayed gratification but I’m trying to train myself to have more tangible things that will last longer than a snack as a reward. I also use points on a weekend massage after a hard workout week and it is worth it!

Some days you do just need ice cream, though.",9jysmx,e6v4lgi,2018-09-29 18:01:29

Stress eating anyone?,"Stress eating is a type of coping mechanism that's there to help your brain deal with the world around you, and ultimately coping helps protect you. Any coping mechanism has positive aspects and negative aspects, some can be more destructive than others. Some people cope with restriction/dieting as a way to feel in control. Some people use alcohol or other drugs, or even self-harm.

I think stress eating is such a core coping mechanism for me, something I learned as a really young child, that it'll never fully go away. However, what I did was expand my repertoire of coping mechanisms so stress eating won't always be the first and only go-to when I'm feeling overwhelmed. You probably will have to test a lot of these out to see if any of them feel useful in the moment and aren't just a fake coping mechanism and you still go back to food afterwards. These can be things like: meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, seeking support, other self-care activities, physical activity (but as someone with a history of ED, I'd put a disclaimer to be careful if physical activity becomes compulsive and a punishment for eating). I've actually found stress cooking to be a coping mechanism that fulfills a lot of the same needs as stress eating, but the time spent cooking is more of a self-care point for me too. I made some crepes for lunch today and it was one of the most relaxing things. I still stress eat occasionally, but the nice thing is the guilt associated with it has dissipated a lot because I take care of myself in other ways too. I don't beat myself up for having something indulgent that I'm really craving - it calms me down and helps me move on with my day. I follow Intuitive Eating, so that colors my perspective here. It won't work for everyone, but it's an idea of somewhere to go if you're looking for a new direction.",9jysmx,e6v8uqm,2018-09-29 19:08:22

[NeedAdvice] How to overcome stress-eating?,"What I did that helped was grab a huge pack of sugar-free gum and a 12-pack of seltzer water. When I would get compulsion to stress eat, I would chew a huge amount of gum and drink 3 or 4 seltzers.

The chewing motion from the gum, along with the fizzy bubbles from the seltzer making me feel full tricked my brain into thinking I had just eaten a bunch of food, so it released the happy-chemicals.

I've found myself a neat little life hack to deal with emotional eating,"A quick one that stands out is teeth brushing. When I would get a craving I would brush my teeth and for some reason that would help so I kept doing it. 

Another one is zero calorie drinks. When I craved a sweet treat I would eat something healthy and wash it down w a sweet drink like Minute Maid zero. Diet soda is 100 percent ok and I have no idea why it's so demonized. 

Sleep. Sleep is a huge one for me bc many of my cravings where at night. This one takes a lot more discipline but just going to sleep if you're having a particularly bad night can solve a problem. Melatonin and cannabis where my friend. 

I eat low carb so nuts is a big part of my diet. I had a rule where I could only handle as many nuts as nature would allow. So I could only have 2 peanuts or 1 almond at a time. This helped me bc I would have handfuls of things and eat more. 

Vaping. I don't recommend anyone start doing this I hate the habit but I'll be dammed if a desert flavored vape didn't help me through some hard times. 

Eating windows. Im not a fan of IF but i am a fan of not eating after 9. Doing so helps me stay regular and eat less. Im at a point now where I can't even poop the next morning if I eat after 9.

Buy some lockbox containers for inside shared fridge.

That means, every week she is eating all of the food out of the fridge? For me, that would be nearly a week's worth of food. So...in short, she's eating all of your food all of the time? In this economy?!

I really don't think you can legally leave her with no place to store her perishables. If there are 3 other girls in the house that means there are 5 of you and ONE roommate is causing all of that damage? This person is a thief and worse than that, she has no respect for your boundaries and has no intention of stopping. It's not like...oops, it was in the fridge and I ate it. It's the fact that she also breaks into your personal space and steals the food you have hidden. She needs to be in therapy and she needs to be held accountable for her behavior. 

Keep the lock on the main fridge to protect the 4 of you and all of you pool together to buy her a mini fridge for Christmas. A mini fridge has to cost less that replacing all the food she eats 3-4 times a week. Get locks for your bedrooms. Go to the grocery store with her and have her pay for the (reasonable amount) of groceries for all of you.

It was almost as thin as a chocolate shaving, but thick enough to not melt into the other layers. It created this wonderful delicate momentary crunch that offset the softness of the desert, and the bitterness of the dark chocolate offset the overall sweetness of the dessert. I’m going to add that layer next time I make this. Maybe just drizzle in some melted semisweet or dark chocolate between two of the chilled layers.  Happy baking!",1hjrvq7,m3bombz,2024-12-22 19:18:16

I had to get a lock for my bedroom with a roommate because she'd keep walking in without knocking and I like to not wear a lot when I'm relaxing in private.

I don't have answers, clearly...but I will share an epiphany. I'm in a different phase of my life than you are and it's taken this much time (and hours of therapy) to understand that my weight gain is not about the food. I eat to self-soothe. It's the same reason I became addicted to alcohol (660 days sober today!). I had a traumatic and damaging childhood and eating gave me joy. Sometimes it was the only joy. And in that way, overeating is a trauma response. 

But I am not the same person anymore. And I am working through that trauma and if I can quick alcohol, I *know* I can quit unhealthy eating. I just need to keep trying. 

There are reasons you overeat, and I promise you...it isn't lack of willpower or any type of character flaw. There are honest-to-goodness reasons and discovering those reasons is the key.",lqx48f,goj3e5a,2021-02-24 00:57:56

My relationship with food was also a result of self-soothing, albeit not directly because of a specific trauma. I was depressed and anxious, and food, especially either fatty or sugary food, releases those sweet, sweet feel-good hormones. At a time when I loathed myself already and felt hopeless, I didnt care about the effects it had in the long term, I was just trying to cope at the moment.

"I hope non-positive posts are allowed here.

I thought that maybe since my past lead me to disordered drinking, maybe it lead me to overeating, too. I was discussing all of the mindless snacking at work and it occurred to me that on Saturdays at work (which are non-business days and I'm mostly alone), I could go the whole day not even thinking about food. So, what was different about Saturdays? No stress and no conflict. And most importantly, no triggers. Stress and triggering events were leading me to self-soothe with food. It kind of started there. It's been most helpful in keeping the negative self-talk at bay. My past wasn't my fault, and my eating was a response to that. It was a learned behavior to help me get by all of those years, and it can be unlearned.",lqx48f,gokilmg,2021-02-24 10:41:08

I don't think the majority of men actually care about women,"A thought I had recently about the whole ""male loneliness epidemic"" thing was that a major reason for men being lonely is that they literally don't see women as human. Like, they'd obviously say aloud that women are humans, except when they accidentally let slip something like the phrase ""the female species"", but their actions show that they do not see women as humans. So they're living in a world with 50% fewer people around for them to form connections with, to empathize with, to befriend, etc. And between that and them making up random, strict rules about when and how and where they can show emotion, they end up lonely. But instead of actually trying to fix that, they blame women for not trying harder to alleviate their loneliness - even though they wouldn't truly *allow* that, because they refuse to relate to women as fellow human beings. Feminists are actually trying to change the root causes of this problem, by getting men to see women as human and by trying to eliminate arbitrary sexist rules, but men see them as just making the problem worse. Because they don't want help, they don't want the problem to be fixed, because when you see women as fellow human beings, it's a lot harder to see them as objects.",1i3p4fw,m7shkw9,2025-01-18 12:16:37

I don't think the majority of men actually care about women,"A WOMANS BODY IS ALLOWED TO CHANGE (Especially, if she’s a mother)  She should be entitled to the reassurance that she will still be supported, and committed to through those changes, should they occur. 

END. OF. STORY. 

If you’re a man,
And you want kids, (desire the experience of fatherhood) And you simultaneously reserve the belief that you can leave your partner, if her body happens to change after having a child, Then YOU need to seriously consider adopting instead…

I’m sick and tired of seeing men complain on Reddit about being with a women who won’t lose weight after she has had their child!?!?

To the men, Yeah yeah yeah, I get it, we all have our physical standards yada yada yada… you have every right to that, I respect your right to reserve that belief for your pursuits🙄

HOWEVER From the context of rearing, and showing up for FAMLIY, this rhetoric needs to be SERIOUSLY cognitively reassessed.

Women’s bodies change, whether they like it or not, especially and particularly, when they choose to have a child. If you’re not willing to accept that potential truth as a reality, then YOU need to MATURE and EVOLVE, or come to terms with the fact that a partnered family life is NOT FOR YOU.

NO more of this, believing your wife just needs to adopt healthier habits to shift their appearance back to what it was etc etc WOMENS BODIES AND BRAINS CHANGE WHEN THEY ARE PREGNANT. This is NOT within anyone’s locus of control. If you’re not willing to support her through those changes, then you need to respectfully excuse yourself from desiring a family.

Again, woman’s bodies change when they have children. 

There is a purpose for that change, and it is to provide comfort, and safety, and love to the very being that they fought through physical trauma to bring into the world. If she happens to have her metabolism shift, guess what? That’s her genetic biology trying to ensure longitudinal survival for not only herself now, but for an offspring too. 

She doesn’t have control over those biological aspects of her genetic makeup in the same way that you, as a man, have no control over the potential that your head might be balder than my pussy after a fresh Brazilian in the next 10 years 😽

If you cannot accept this fact, and you purportedly say you want a family!?!? while still maintaining a belief that you hold a right to leave someone if they can’t be at a target weight within your preferences then:

YOU ARE NOT EMOTIONALLY MATURE ENOUGH FOR A FAMILY. 

If you want to experience fatherhood, while still maintaining the aforementioned belief system then YES! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ALMIGHTY ADOPT… you can be a single parent, or you can even have a male partner instead💁🏽‍♀️👬

HOWEVER 

If you want to start a family with a woman, then you better fucking be willing to ride with her through whatever changes she may experience, albeit mental health and/or physical. If you’re not willing to do that. 

I’ll say it again.

YOU ARE NOT WORTHY.

And thus, I would advise against it. 

And that is me reclaiming this perspective from the MFing  patriarchy because fxck all these Reddit comments about men contemplating whether they “have the right to their preferences, and physical standards.”

I’m over that bullshit, it’s unseasoned, improper, patriarchal rhetoric that does not center family or love at its core. 

I want none of that in the future society that needs to be built. If it is family that you purportedly desire

Not sure why the link is wonky, but here's the comment in full from [psychedelic666](https://www.reddit.com/user/psychedelic666/): 

""I always drop this quote bc it is 100% accurate. It captures exactly what you are talking about perfectly.

“To say that straight men are heterosexual is only to say that they engage in sex (fucking exclusively with the other sex, i.e., women). All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men. The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire… those are, overwhelmingly, other men. In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal. From women they want devotion, service and sex.

Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving.”

It is entirely possible for men to be different — but the society we live in, the media we interact with, the way our communities speak about women, all add up.

As a test in my early 30s I worked a physically demanding job and also tried to bulk up for a whole year. Eating more, getting enough protein, got into lifting. Barely anything happened! I didn't even change 1 clothing size. I even had a trainer. It was so much work and cost of food to gain like 1/4 inch on my thighs that I gave up. Lifting 5x a week and working that job also seemed to mess with my hormones and triggered ovarian cysts. It was really deflating to see how hard it would be for this body. It sucked because I liked lifting.

They don't want to be treated like your typical male sex object, i.e. a woman -- as a piece of equipment to be used, exploited and traded at will. So by going all in on misogyny, they can signal that they are first and foremost *entitled* to patriarchal privilege.

Add to this the fact that gay men lack the motivation for transactional civility toward women that hetero men have. Straight men have to pretend to treat women as people in order to get access to the good. Gay men have no interest in women as either people or sexual objects, so they can hate without sexual consequence.

I don't think the majority of men actually care about women,"Disclaimer: Not a single thing I say next is in any capacity meant to defend these absolute aholes.

I *think* this is the same phenomenon as when unhealthily clingy people won't stop texting. So much is projected onto one activity/action (""validation"" by way of sex) that tunnel vision makes them incapable of really thinking about the bigger picture (coercion makes people rightfully hate you).

""As long as we have sex, relationship good."" seems to be an insanely common misconception that I'd blame on toxic masculinity start to finish. So much weight is put on whether dudes have sex and how much of it and with whom, the obesssion turns unhealthy with a **lot** of men.

So I'd argue this is genuinely one of those brilliant examples for how *hard* toxic masculinity leads to these absolute *idiots* shooting themselves in the foot. They're so idiotically busy with whether they get there, they'd risk the love of their life and more for it.

And considering how many convicted rapists to this day insist that rape is not what occured - or how a certain fucking author is literally pulling that ""defense"" as we speak - it's safe to say the lot of them successfully gaslight themselves into thinking successful coercion = good news.

I don't think the majority of men actually care about women,"Edit: Oops. Unplanned rant.

> Men don't listen to women; they adjust their behavior to be judged more favorably by other men.

TL;DR - It'd probably also be fair to also say (some) ""men don't listen to women, they merely make note of the correction as a tool for being judged more favorably by women moving forward"" as well.

For example: ""Sheesh! They really don't like when I talk about politics, eh? Wait, I'm a genius! I'll just avoid alluding to my politics entirely, at least until either the third date or we sleep together; whichever one comes first.""

This is not necessarily a *conscious* strategy - not everyone is that Machiavellian - but that's precisely why I frequently remind women that everyone has an opinion in this day and age - *everyone*. That's not a cynical declaration, it's a statistical one.

Somebody who genuinely agrees with your stance will be probably excited by the discovery of any philosophical alignment, not unconcerned or outright flippant, and absolutely not seemingly deflective. They'd be more excited than *that* just to discover that both of you may have stopped by the same guy's hotdog stand during that one time either of you visited Manhattan or whatever, right?

>First Date: ""The guy with the moustache? Red and yellow cart?? *Mario's Magnificent Meatsticks*?! Yes! Holy shit, that's incredible. Wow, I was just there last month! Oh, for a feminism convention you say? Cool, cool. That's... Yeah. Anyway, so what kind of hotdog did you order? Did he still have those tiny churros? Man, his accent was funny, wasn't it!""

Riiight. Not troubling at all. Just a perfectly normal hotdog fanatic, that's all.

A silent response is generally always an act of omission, a 'null reply' which betrays the presence of something that - by necessity - was either assessed to be potentially irrelevant, inappropriate, uncomfortable, unwelcome, or recognized as flat-out harmful for one reason or another.

""Eh, I'm not really into politics haha"" is itself a political statement by nature of the implications. If one actually cared enough to care, they'd care enough to know that claiming to be apolitical implies a particular sort of ideological foundation ""by default"". To say such a thing at all typically requires either genuine ignorance of the association or a desire to merely feign ignorance of it.

Especially within a modern culture where there is typically only one particular kind of *'politics'* infamous for diminishing one's courtship opportunities rather than increasing them... 

*Very* few men are naïve enough to casually risk being deemed ""romantically non-viable"" by accidentally implying that trans-people should be terminated or that women should lose the right to vote or whatever by offering a lazy non-answer to a question they didn't realize carried significant weight.

You can only make *that* caliber of mistake so many times before making note of the correlation, no matter how ""autistic"" or ""clueless"" you might claim to be.

Not once have I met a man whose feigned *or* honest claim of being ""mostly apolitical haha"" did not eventually result in the reveal of a handful of discernably troubling beliefs or expectations (none of which were of the ""the proletariat shall rise again"" variety of troubling, unfortunately). Typically not *evil* people or anything, just something more like ""What the hell, James. Are you *stupid* or something?""

Turns out that certain ideologies require some baseline level of empathy/insight to hold at all. 

""Actually giving a shit"" is the *[Must Be This Tall To Ride]* signboard of leftist/liberal perspectives, and those who can get onto that particular roller-coaster without being stopped by the attendant are unafraid to freely express the excitement of the ride, so to speak. They're not worried about describing it the wrong way or saying too much.

Reluctance to share openly easily identifies the posers. If it was actually fun, why are you deflecting? If you enjoy it so much, why won't you come ride it with me? Was that crumpled up confederate flag I found in the bed of your pickup *really* just your younger brother's idea of a silly prank, Daniel? *Really*, Daniel??

...I digress, sorry. Not entirely sure what happened here.

Anyway, I just wanted to add-on to your very good point/question. It sucks to feel so skeptical, but it's good to keep in mind that some people really are just *that* Not Good. Some people's ethical frameworks can sometimes be downright... Alien. And there are actors in the ""manosphere"" openly explaining the values of this kind of strategy too, unfortunately. My point isn't that men suck, it's that the men who *don't* suck are typically extremely easy to spot if you know what to look for.",1i3p4fw,m7qbsjd,2025-01-18 01:23:23

And I do it too, for the reasons you state. If it is coming from both sides of the aisle then they get the hurt from being poorly judged by a guy and the loud rejection from women.  If they are smart enough, at some point they reassess their approaches.

And slightly related, guys do stuff that they don't share with other guys because they know it's cringe and those  we cannot pass the judgement on.

I totally agree with you. You bought that food for yourself. And your mother is being shitty. She did this to your sister as well.

Sadly, as long as you live with your mother, there is not much you can do. She has the power to punish you or kick you out, so you don't have the power to set boundaries or show anger. :(

The biggest problem is your father. If he wouldn't keep all the decent food for himself, your mother would be able to get a good meal and wouldn't feel the need to do this. Your mother did this out of desperation because your father is an arsehole.",1ccambx,l1459vg,2024-04-24 22:25:55

few questions.

Im asking as if you are both or one of you are a minor then you can call CPS for child neglect as keeping food away from kids is a big child neglect, just because in a fridge there's a tiny amount of food and in a pantry you have a couple of things doesn't mean that the 2 of you are having enough food to make nutricious meals every day and your parents truly deserve to be put in jail for neglecting and then emotionally abusing their own kids.

AITA for yelling at my mom because she ate the food that I bought with my money?,"You live in an extremely dysfunctional household. How old are you? Another commenter said that you’re in your 20s, but I wanted to confirm.

If you’re a minor, you’re not being provided for. If you’re under 18, your parents (father, in this case, apparently) owes you adequate sustenance. If you are underage, please contact CPS or let a trusted adult (a reliable extended family member, a friend’s parent, or a school counselor) know that you are being neglected. 

If you are of age, you will unfortunately either have to move out or find a way to hide your food from your mother. I hate to say that because it honestly sounds like your mother is hungry and can’t afford her own food. You say your dad hoards the food and actually guards a key to it? That’s untenable, cruel, and highly unusual. Is he like Baron Karkonnen? Is he some big balloon floating around eating himself silly while you and your mom survive off of scraps? Or does he share food with her?

Anything you put in the kitchen is going to be consumed by either him or her. I know you don’t make a lot of money. Is there a way you can eat your big dinner outside of the home in the evening so you don’t leave it vulnerable to your mother’s attacks? Can you buy a mini fridge and keep it in your bedroom and stock it with a few things?

This is how men get away with being abusive. We hold moms to impossible standards (Starve yourself to death for your children) and forgive dads (or ignore) their abuse.

Most would be. But there are also some who not only put needs but also wants, above the child. I'm grown and had to come back ""home"". A choice i never would've made if not for my own child. I needed to keep her safe and didn't have many options. Being here has been educational for sure.

Some people are just selfish, inconsiderate assholes. It doesn't matter if the person they hurt is their child, as long as they have what they want. Maybe she is abused, maybe she was starving too....but she's married to the guy with the key. She has a job and a vehicle. 

I'm sorry, but there's never a reason to screw over your child, Littles or grown, ESPECIALLY when you have the means to fix the problem. The guilt trip that followed with the ""not working the whole day to go replace a meal"" shows she is manipulative and just a different kind of asshole than dad.

Basic etiquette. Everyone gets a serving on first round that wants one. If any is left over, seconds can be had one piece at a time to whomever wants one but thirds and further repeat the seconds rule. If a guest breaks this rule they don’t get invited back without an apology.

AITAH for Not Serving as Much Food as I Know My Dinner Guests Will Want to Eat? [Concluded],"Wow. 

Polly and Melissa either indeed have a feeder kind situation they are trying to involve unwilling third parties in, or are incredibly selfish people on a powertrip.

Like, imagine the audacity to show up to a dinner invite with a group and host you never met before, and helping yourself to not only all potential second servings for the whole group, but also more, leaving not enough pieces for everyone to get a full slice in the first place. And doing so by laying claim to all that food imediately, rather than starting to eat and taking seconds when you are done with your firsts. She and Polly were invited to a dinner party at someones house, not an all you can eat buffet, and they knew that.

If you need more food than what you know will be served at an event, you eat ahead of time. If you only realize after arrival, you eat your share at the party, then get more food for yourself afterwards. 

It actually matters little why Melissa ""has to"" eat that much. OOP keeps saying she thinks Melissa is sick, not evil. Girl, she is at least both. She knew what you got ""paid"" per person, and outright claimed 8 full pieces of lasagna, on top of salad, soup and cake. For 25€, i might be hard pressed to get 8 generously sized pieces of Supermarket Freezer Lasagna. No way would this even remotely cover 8 pieces a basic homemade lasagna someone else made for you, let alone a frigging luxury lasagna with hours of cooking, butcher meat and (potentially) homemade pasta, on top of 3 more courses. OOP barely ""charges"" more than a laughable amount for a 4 course meal with 1-2 pieces of that lasagna. 

OOP should be glad that Polly and Melissa are no longer part of the group. The trash took itself out

Edit: sorry, had a total brainfart and somehow assumed the currency was Euro. Depending on if this is USD or CAD, my estimate of what each guest paid was a little to high  (USD), or  way too high (CAD).",1ixt9we,mep8k6s,2025-02-25 13:51:05

How she did it though, just taking all the food and not even having room on her plate so she used her bowls etc, that is straight up greed and selfishness. She had zero regard for anyone else at the table and whether or not *they* might also want a second helping.

AITAH for Not Serving as Much Food as I Know My Dinner Guests Will Want to Eat? [Concluded],"Yeah it's just absurdly rude.

Your comment actually reminded me of a weird situation I was in when I was in college.  I decided to take some summer classes and lived in an apartment style dorm for that term.

There were 4 or 5 of us altogether, 3 women who were on the bigger side, me (I was like 20 lbs overweight, so not small by any means but I didn't get classified as ""fat"" by the group) and one extremely thin woman.

Food started going missing.  Little things here and there.  Plus general grossness, like someone would take my juice from the fridge, spill it on the floor, throw some paper towels on the spill, and leave the mess.

It escalated over time.  I tried to mediate and I made a chore chart so people could stop yelling at each other over cleaning/taking out the trash.  It was to no avail.  The conflict sort of distilled itself into two of the bigger girls having daily screaming matches over who was stealing from their expensive organic bacon and soy milk with heavy doses of fat shaming from both sides.  It was basically an early 00s reality show with just absurd drama over relatively low stakes stuff.

Towards the end of the semester I figured out who the culprit was.  I have insomnia and so one night I got up and went into the kitchen to grab something to drink.  I saw the tiny girl putting a bunch of crackers on a plate from a box which had another roommate's name on it.  We made eye contact.  Neither of us said anything.  

Over the next couple of days, I watched her more closely and saw that she often would take large servings of food into her room, then visit the bathroom like 10 minutes later.  It turned out that she was severely bulimic and she had been stealing everyone's food for her binge and purge sessions.

So yeah, it's definitely not ""blame the fat person"".  It's ""blame the person who behaves inappropriately with food"".",1ixt9we,meqhi15,2025-02-25 17:38:05

AITAH for Not Serving as Much Food as I Know My Dinner Guests Will Want to Eat? [Concluded],"Honestly, no. She didn't feel ashamed. 

I was a support worker for group homes for several years, and one of my clients was a woman with severe food addictions. 

When the addiction is enabled like this, the individual doesn't feel shame or guilt for their over consumption. The enablement breeds a sense of complete entitlement to the source of the addiction: food. For the addicted person, they truly and genuinely feel that they are owed or otherwise deserve the food. Without it, they'll wither and expire instantly. Because food is seen as an absooute right to them, anyone that withholds the food (regardless of how much has been consumed) is viewed as actively harming them, even though it's for their own good. 

A substance doesn't have to have addictive qualities for a person's brain chemistry to require it. A person with food addictions will experience withdrawal symptoms similiar to those with a chemical addiction. It's part of why they fight the diet so hard. 

We know logically they aren't starving. But they genuinely feel like they are. That hunger pain drives the over consumption and reinforces that anyone making it harder to over consume is actively harming them. Like any addiction, the brain floods with dopamine and the other feel good chemicals once you obtain the source of the addiction. 

All of this culminates in an extreme victim mentality. They don't get embarrassed or feel guilty about the over consumption. They get angry that you are in the way of the addiction.",1ixt9we,meq58qs,2025-02-25 16:40:06

AITAH for Not Serving as Much Food as I Know My Dinner Guests Will Want to Eat? [Concluded],"This. I’m a pretty large person, but used to be larger - not Melissa-sized, but a BMI approaching 40 - and when I tried Atkins and was younger I could really put it away. There’s a regional steakhouse chain that has good-sized portions, and some large steak options. I used to regularly get their 24 oz steak, plus baked potato, and all-you-can-eat soup and salad bar, and would still finish off my partner’s steak if they were full and didn’t want a doggy bag. This was normal for me, back then. But I learned, eventually, how to cut back, because it just wasn’t healthy. 


And I make a pretty good lasagna, too; not OOP’s 14 layer, it’s like 4 layers and comes up to the brim of a standard 9x13 Pyrex baking dish. And even at my biggest, I suspect 3 pieces of that would have been my limit; these days, I’ll have maybe 1.5 pieces for dinner, if that. Almost triple the number of pieces from my max, at least twice as high, just boggles me. 

And the caloric value of that lasagna is crazy. Doing a quick estimate, the meat sauce is 2500+ calories, the ricotta cheese sauce is 2000+, the shredded mozzarella is 1500+, the two mozzarella balls are 1000+, and the lasagna noodles are like 5000 calories! That’s not including all of the ‘extras’ that go into the sauces! So each lasagna, by her recipe, is at least 12,000 calories! That’s literally enough for a moderately large person for a week!",1ixt9we,mepr7pv,2025-02-25 15:31:59

AITAH for Not Serving as Much Food as I Know My Dinner Guests Will Want to Eat? [Concluded],"Here you go!

- 6 Tbsp butter 
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 eggs
- 3/4 cup dark corn syrup 
- 1 tsp vanilla
- pecans
- pre-heat oven to 275F

I usually double the recipe and just use a whole bottle of dark corn syrup, but don’t worry about emptying the entire bottle, if that makes sense. I pour it into the pot, but once the pour slows down, I stop. 

Using a double boiler, melt butter. Add brown sugar and mix until it’s well integrated. I do this for about 5-10 minutes. Add corn syrup and mix for about 10-15 minutes, until brown sugar is fully integrated with the corn syrup. It’s tricky to keep the heat just right so butter doesn’t separate from the mixture. If it does, it’s okay. Towards end, add salt and vanilla and mix for a few more minutes. Remove from heat and cool. While it cools, chop pecans into quarters. I buy pecan halves and chop, so they are bit fresher. I’ve found pre-chopped pecans are dryer. Once mixture is cooler, fold in eggs. Then add pecans. 

For crust - this makes 2 pie crusts
- 6 oz butter, cut into about 1/2” pieces and frozen
- 2 oz crisco, cut into about 1/2” pieces and frozen
- 12 oz flour (I prefer bread flour)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 Tbsp sugar

Mix dry ingredients together in a bowl. Using a food processor, mix dry ingredients and the frozen butter/crisco.  Should look/feel like thick corn meal. Put it in a bowl and slowly add water (I’m lazy and don’t re-freeze this, or add ice cubes to the water.  It would probably be a better crust if i did) until it holds together. 

Roll the crust into a large ball, then split into two balls. Roll the crust out until it’s about 1/2” wider in diameter than your pie pan. Put it in your pan, pinch the edges, and pour mixture in.  I don’t pre-bake the crust. Never noticed a different other than burnt crust edges. 

Bake for about an hour. I check at around 40 minutes. The top will start puffing up. You’ll know it’s done when the middle is soft but resistant to the touch. 

Remove and let it completely cool down. That helps it finish baking and lets the filling rest. 

Enjoy!",1ixt9we,meqfm0p,2025-02-25 17:29:08

I’ve gained the “DOGE 15”. You?,"State worker here, and I can share a recipe my dad made us growing up that I still cook today. Its very easily variable, too, so you could make half and half if you so wished or something like that. 

I also have made some stew like stuff from my dad's recipes too, but this is less stew.... though you could easily swap a couple things to make it one, I'd bet. 

Its relatively simple and once you have your preferred spices figured out especially, its easy to cook often. 

We called it brown meat and rice....because it's literally browned ground meat, rice, spices and a bag of frozen veggies. I'm autistic and its my go to dinner when I have at least a couple spoons (of energy lol) left for the day. 

-----------------
Ingredients: 
Ground chicken (1lb, but 2 lasts a bit longer). (Can use ground turkey as well.) 
Chicken Bullion (3 cubes, or powder equivalent. Brown gravy packets also work as a substitute). (You can use others, i personally just prefer chicken. It's just to help increase/enhance the flavor of chicken, you can go without if you so wish.) 
Bag of mixed veggies (1 per pound of meat). Frozen, usually BUT you can change to whatever you like for that. Veggies, peppers, fruit i guess too, never tried that but could be interesting. 
2-2.5 cups water (1 cup for the rice, 1 for the veggies, more for more liquid, less for if you want it to pretty much all evaporated or be absorbed. I'd recomend no less than 2 cups though. 
1/2 cup rice. (Noodles can also be subbed, or you could do white rice seperately from the mix.) 
Spices (i use Thyme, Basil, Oregano, Parsley, Salt, Pepper, Italian seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder + maybe 1/3 teaspoon cocoa powder. I feel like I'm forgetting one, but this is at least most of them. 

The cocoa powder just ties everything together and helps enhance things. Why? Idk. But it does. Just don't use too much bc that will get bitter.)

I also prefer to pre-prep spices in a small cup or bowl. I could not tell you the measurements bc i do them by feel, but basically it usually ends up a nice mixture with the cocoa. I do use a LOT of salt, fwiw, but I have a thing called POTS (dysautonomic disorder) and salt is part of helping with it. 

You can easily swap spices for something spicy, or whatever flavors you prefer. 

To cook: 

Brown the meat in a pan on medium to high heat, I use butter for the pan but you can probably swap with whatever also works like that. 
Add the bullion cubes/bullion/gravy packet, and the water.
(I personally toss the bullion in a small cup of bot water to help soften my cubes, but its not strictly necessary. It usually ends up about maybe a half cup if that of water it is in.)
Ensure all bullion is dissolved in the pan. 
Add the spices! 
Add the rice! 
Add the veggies! 

Turn to medium or low medium heat. Cover with plate, lid, foil, etc. We used all 3 (different times) growing up. Let it start simmering/small boil. When its simmering, turn it down to low heat and set timer for 40ish minutes. More or less depending on your stove and how you prefer your rice. 

When 40 min is up, check and add time if needed, but that's it. 
----------


You can easily swap the rice for noodles (I'd recommend breaking them up a bit first, from recent experience, but its really good), the mixed veggies bag (less than $1 each at aldi AND walmart, aldi is a couple cents cheaper) for corn, or broccoli, or whatever. You can add cheese and just do broccoli and viola, you've got cheesy broccoli brown meat. 

If I didn't pre-prep the spices and such, it would probably take ~10-20 min to get to the point where I let it simmer, but I do prep so i can just toss and go. Bonus points, if you have kids and they want to help, you could figure out what measurements you prefer for spices and have them help out. Its relatively simple for a recipe and you can freeze rhe ground meat if you buy in bulk, and cut down on frequency of shopping trips. 

This was how my dad, recently laid off during the 2008 recession, fed a family 2 kids and 2 adults and usually cooked every night or every other night or so. I usually cook once every three days living alone. If you make 2 pounds instead of 1, it will probably last one person an entire work week, tbh.

It was such a good dinner I still remember and make it myself as a recently independent adult in my first apartment. I work in state government, which also is not the highest paying, haha, but it's affordable for me too, especially with an Aldi right down the road. If there were a Sams or Costco close I'd be buying the meat in bulk. You can get a shitton of the bullion cubes on Amazon for relatively cheap. I did that a few months ago and I'm not even halfway through them. 

Its easily changable for ingredients and variety and not crazy hard to cook. Once its simmering, you can pause to rest, or you can do dishes or whatever in between because of the low heat especially. Scoop some in some containers and just grab and go every morning. Doing spices by feel every time also helps make it less monotonous, lol. 

I'm actually eating it for breakfast right now, haha. Made some last night, probably will make more tommorow night because i eat SO much when I make this, its ridiculous. 

Anyways. Hope maybe this helps, and as a state worker, I see you, appreciate you and am doing what I can to fight for you. Maybe it's just me, maybe its a lot of us, but I'm in this to do real good, help folks, and keep people safe, happy and things well run.

What are your favorite Aldi stress-eating buys?,"I buy a lot of charcuterie type items from Aldi. Meat & cheese & fruit and veggie grazing boxes are one of our go-to lunches.

(I usually do one on our vacation days since it's pretty easy and versatile) The lemon ricotta cheese is so good, one of my favs right now.

I just bought the sherbet hummus and it's gonna be a repeat item for us. We pair it with animal or graham crackers and fruit. (Bananas rock with the hummus). I used the chocolate hummus w/ peanut butter and tortillas and bananas to do a roll up, so might try a fruit and sherbet hummus rollup.

We also use the hummus as a vegetable dip to sub in instead of ranch dressing.

AITA for blowing up at my stepsister at her comments about my lost weight?,"Mostly agreed, but a few points:

1. He might apologize for making a scene if he thinks it'd help, but not for the actual words, which were justified.

2. He should stand by and repeat that this was the culmination of ten years of bullying by the sister, abetted by the parents.

3. He might point out that she's much older than he was when she started bullying him, so no definition of ""she's younger"" can justify her actions.  Either she's old enough to take it in now (and too old to dish it out) or he was too young to be expected to take it in before.

ETA 4. He might want to direct some portion of his communication at his stepsister alone.  That way he can point out that the ""She's much younger"" comments mean that her mother refuses to see her as an adult (or responsible for her actions), even at age 20, and that's a problem for everyone.

At 12 or so months he do things like, my then five year old would be sitting there minding his own and he'd crawl up and head butt him.   


He's a genuine sweet, kind, easy to get along with person to literally everyone else, including his 9 year old sister and 1.5 year old brother and all his peers and my 8 year old is a very good egg indeed BUT they can rarely be in a room together for 5 minutes without exploding and my 4 year old is usually the instigator.  


All that to say, at 6 and 10 the 6 year old could definitely bully the 10 year old and at 11 and 15, when the worst of it started according to OP, I'd argue, depending on stage of puberty they were at, the 11 year old might actaully be more rational and in charge of their emotions.

Parents also need to go to the younger child and explain what they did that was wrong, why it was mean/bad, and get them to apologize. 

""Be the bigger person because you're older"" is only a method to get the older kids to accept the apology and not instigate further trouble; not a method to get them to act as a door mat.

No, it isn't, you have the benefits wrong, see the links below they're damn near identical and from separate world renowned leading health professionals.

It's the proven method for fighting treatment resistant epilepsy (especially in children) and shows other neurological promise.

However, No leading health institution claims anything other than short term and mixed results using it to lose weight, they flat out state that while it works well for some it's been shown multiple times not to be safe or effective for other people regardless of underlying health conditions.

Longterm (life long) results in every link below are stated as unknown because the studies out their fall short.

She may even be into something like pole dancing (it’s an unbelievable full body workout, and super confidence building).  Installing a proper pole is actually a very challenging structural engineering project, so it can get pricey.

She may also prefer an exercise cycle or an elliptical.  Both are very good machines, and a cycle has the extra benefit of possibly turning into a tv or gaming seat.

WIBTAH for straight up leaving and ghosting my fiancee after I found out she cheated,"If you sub to AITA and adjacent subs enough you start to see some common tropes within a certain flavor of story, and it becomes *so* obvious once you start to notice them.

* In every one of these, they are in their 20s.
* Everyone has a house they own fully. Sometimes *multiple* houses, which are used as convenient plot devices
* Everyone comes into massive inheritance solely because they are the protagonist of the story. OOP can be the youngest child or a grandchild with living parents and multiple aunts and uncles, and they alone will inherit everything good. Sometimes this will be explained by them saying that they were just so angelic and kind to the now deceased relative and everyone else was wicked and greedy.
* They all have vague yet *extremely* well paying jobs. These jobs love them, and will transfer them anywhere they want with no questions asked. Or they work from home, and it's fine. They can move around to wherever they want.
* Cash is never an issue.
* They all have lawyers who can get things resolved in a matter of days. Court cases are arranged and fly by! You can just walk up to a courthouse and see a judge. If anyone points out how unrealistic they are, then OOP suddenly doesn't live in America. (Though they will often use very US-centric terms) OOP will never specify what country they are from. (To prevent the post from being too identifiable, despite the fact that they have written an incredibly specific scenario that would identify them instantly)
* If AITA is to be believed, every pregnancy has a 50% chance of twins.
* With breakup posts, the family of the other person are either comically evil and ""blowing up their phone"" or they acknowledge that their shitty child is actually a horrible person, and graciously say that OOP deserves better and that they wish that OOP was their child, instead of the cheater.
* The posts all come in waves. One person posts on AITA about drama at a wedding and it hits r/all? Well, now *everyone* on AITA has conveniently just attended a wedding and encountered basically the same situation. Someone posts about how awful an autistic person they encountered was? Yeah, it turns out that everyone also knows an autistic person who did the same thing.
* Updates are paced like 2 days apart, and yet somehow a month's worth of events have happened.
* Bonus if the update contains something that was mentioned by other commenters in the first post. (ex: Someone posts about their boyfriend constantly opening their food and leaving it open in the fridge. AITA will create the worst possible scenario in their head and go ""OMG! I would set up a webcam or something, what if he's tampering with it?"" and then the update is ""Guys, you'll never believe it. It turns out my boyfriend is cartoonishly evil. I thought he was just sticking his fingers in my hummus to eat some himself, but he was actually mixing drain cleaner and semen into it. I didn't mention it at all in the past post, but I've been chronically ill ever since he moved in."")
* Everything is neatly wrapped up. The angelic protagonist will actually be better off than they were at the beginning, and the wicked antagonist will have their life ruined and be reduced to a shrieking and disgraced mess.",1bb23ze,ku6w7xk,2024-03-10 07:24:59

* The protagonist will, without fail, suggest therapy or be in therapy. The cost of this, especially in cases of couples or family therapy, is never referenced as an obstacle (which likely circles back to the protagonists being in $150k p/y as a minimum).",1bb23ze,ku71mtz,2024-03-10 08:28:36

i have been with my fiancé for 7 years and known him for 11. he has just kept loving me, no matter how long or how intensely i struggled. to this day, he is ultra enthusiastic about me. whenever i have to get changed or have to bend down to pick something up, he whistles at me or will sidle up to me and start flirting. 😂 (i like it, no worries.) even though i still struggle with my self-esteem, he has loved me so well fornso long that it has absolutely raised my standards in other relationships and lowered my tolerance for bullshit in other relationships, from other people.

They say “no worries, thanks for the offer.” And that’s the end of it.

But they were compassionate and lovely people and never gave me a hard time about it. Reacting so negatively, as OP’s roommate did, is understandable. I’ve also come home from a long day of work, looking forward to food I thought would be at home. But ultimately, it was O0’s food, not roommate’s, even if there was an offer to share.

Add to it that you're consuming all this *without* exercising throughout the day (an assumption, but people working from home rarely have time to run for an hour and do other exercises) so it's extra bad because you're taking in all these calories and nutrients but you're not *using* them

I have a friend who acts like this, and constantly says, ""I just love food"" but so do I. Food is great.

OP didn’t mention their exercise regimen, we have no idea what they’re up to. 

OP obviously would benefit from better stress management but it’s not as easy to sort out as people think. I’ve had decades of therapy, in-patient treatment, out-patient treatment, medication, everything there is to try. It helps but I still binge more than I should (even though you’d never know it to look at me bc exercise). Ugh I have so much sympathy for this person, it’s such a frustrating and embarrassing issue, but it doesn’t mean they’re not exercising or taking care of other aspects of their life.",10hfyww,j59zmo8,2023-01-21 13:53:16

How to stop stress eating processed food?,"I was/am in a similar boat. The best advice I can give is to not buy the crappy processed stuff to keep in the house. If you can order groceries online for pick up it’s a lot easier than walking down the isle and throwing those snacks in the cart. Also, deleting all saved credit card info from any pizza/ubereats/grubhub type things on your phone/computer. Make it as hard as possible for you to actually order the junk food. 

As far as not having energy to cook. I suggest learning to make an easy meal like grilled/baked chicken breasts and sautéed veggies. You can always change the seasoning and veggies enough to mix up the flavors. If you’re making that 5/6 meals a week then you’re already eating healthy 1/3 of the time.

 Also never underestimate the ease and frugality of a small baked potato. A little sour cream, some scallion, some grated cheese, holy yum, batman.

There have been cases on here where someone swaps something out or puts something in someone’s food without their knowledge, or to “test” an allergy, or to trick them into eating something they claim they don’t like. 

This is not the case with your situation. He said you could both stand to eat healthier (“make a change”), and swapping out high-carb, calorie-dense foods with healthy equivalents is literally Healthy Eating 101. 

I mean...

What did he expect you to do? Like you said, there were no complaints until he actually realized you were swapping out foods. Assuming he has no aversions and no allergies, you’re right: he’s being a fucking child. If he wants to bitch about the food that you make (without any of his help, apparently) then he gets to make his own meals. 

The fact that he didn’t even know you were substituting foods shows how much he contributes to your meal prep. Good on you for not giving in to his tantrum. He’s a grown up (at least in age). He is perfectly capable of making himself food, or even driving his own self to get takeout.

If he doesn't wany to eat that food. You should stop making such large portions and only make enough for yourself.

I'm a clinical psychologist and can share my personal understanding on this, some of which has already been stated by others in the replies, some of which might be a new input.


As many might already know, the state of flow is coneptualized as more or less equivalent ballance of personal ability and difficulty of the task. You can skip the following example if you're already familiar with the princip. Say for example you're a boxer, have been training for about 2 years now and your first fight is coming up. Should the oponent be of roughly the same weight, age and skill as you, the difficulty for you both will be high enough that it demands your full attention. However the skill of the opponent might not be too much higher than yours, so that you feel overwhelmed during the figh. In the optimal scenario both of you become so immersed, without being depressed or frustrated, that you blend out everything around you, even time and fight to your full potential. Easy enough to understand I hope. Now should your opponent be a lot more experienced, say 5 years into training, the difficulty of the task will take up more of your attention and energy than you can handle. You might become frustrated, irritated, hopeless and in the end you won't be able to enter the tunnel of flow. Same goes for when the opponent is way weaker, the task becomes so easy that your brain will not deem it worthy of your full attention. And though you will probably win, entering the flow tunnel will probably not happen in this scenario either, since your brain will be bored, have too much room for other thoughts and stimuli. I hope that wasn't too wordy.

With that in mind, let's look at video games. Say you start playing pokemon for the first time, just as an example. The game is new, but the single steps to understanding it are probably not too difficult to comprehend. You learn how to catch pokemon, how to fight, how to level, etc. If the game happens to be around your level of skill you will lose track of time and be immersed in it. However if it happens to be your 20th playthrough, you might start with enthusiasm, yet lose interest 2 hours in because the difficulty is far to low for you, no challenges exist and so you are just strolling by. You might still keep playing (I will get to that in a moment), but you won't enter flow state. Same goes of course once again for when you play a game that is too hard for you. Online games are the easiest examples of this. Whenever I try to play Battlefield or CoD online at my friend's place I stop about 5 minutes into the round, simply because I do not even understand where I'm getting shot at from or where the enemies even are. Therefore, no flow state for me either. 

Games, just like drugs (albeit fairly weaker, depending on the drug of course) have another ace up their sleeve however. The reward. With the flow state, the result is not always of importance, sometimes not at all. If an artist works on a sculpture or painting for 3 months, he might still enter flow on most of the days, but the result doesn't happen until he is finished. You don't get a medal every time you spar in your boxing gym, neither do you get a degree every time you read an interesting paper. Of course the personal joy and fulfillment, or the things we learn might count as a result, but I'm talking about an actual tangible goal here (the discussion about what could count as a result would derail this a lot, so just bear with me). And of course once again same could be said about video games. I don't need to see my minecraft house be finished in one day, BUT, the tens, sometimes hundrets, maybe thousands of small ""results"" sprinkled inbetween the gameplay are the exact hits to the reward system our brain loves so much. Forging a sword in real life? How about 5 years of training and tens of hours of work. Forging a sword in Skyrim? Click, done, there it is, shiny and new. Training a pet to do an awesome trick in real life? Months, maybe years to go. Teaching a pokemon a new attack? Just 13 more minutes of grinding and I can use Ember. Those little rewards can keep you to the screen even if the game does not give you the actual flow of difficult enough but not too hard. And time goes by in that way fast. 

Now, for the work question. I personally think, that the idea of finding work which gives you lets you enter a flow state, is a very high demand and goal to put on yourself. Maybe 1-5% of people in the workforce have that luxury. And if you really have something you want to pursue that you love and make a living off of it, awesome. But most people are not as fortunate. 

Hunting wasn't always fun for our ancestors. I don't imagine them being out there experiencing flow for 4 days straight, itching to go back whenever they brought their prey home immediately. It was rough, but what made them do it was the reward of feeding themselves and caring for their loved ones. That's exactly why drugs (aswell as porn and games) are such easy to get addicted to habits. You take the ballance of exhausting yourself because it's worth it and skew it way towards the ""worth it"" with a lot less ""exhausting"" (in the short term that is). Working out and eating healthy for a healthy body in your fifties is hard, good in the long term, but hard. Eating pizza and playing games for 15 hours straight is not hard compared to how fun it is, and you don't have to wait for the result in the future. The fun and tasty happens now. Taking cocaine? How about an experience of reward 100 times that of any activity you enjoy for the difficulty of sniffing powder up your nose. 

That's why I always tell my clients that the ""why"" of their pursuit is so important. I'll stay with the drugs for a tad more. Suppose you want to drop alkohol. Tough process (even live-threatening if you do it yourself), the cravings will be really massive the first months and they won't leave for the rest of your life, sure they'll become more seldom, weaker, shorter, but they will always be there. And one drink might mean months of consumtion again. So of course the brain at some point will ask itself ""why the f*ck am I doing this?"". That's the point where you need an answer, if you don't have it, the reptilian part of the brain, looking for immediate problem solution will kick in and look for the next bottle. 

To come full circle: If you have the possibility to pursue your dream job, great. If not, then you might try to not impose a standard of ""I should enter flow at my work somehow"" on yourself. Make your job easier, sure, more manageable, find fun things to do, maybe form solid realtionships with co-workers. But ask yourself what your ""why"" is outside of it. Maybe to support your family, maybe to support your hobby, maybe to keep a roof over your head and food in your stomach because you have other goals a year from now. Whatever it is, find that and try to lessen the stress your job gives you. Remeber, the hunt doesn't have to be fun or put you into flow, but you need that prey.

That was long, sorry. But Corona gave me some time to spent and I tend to be a bit wordy when explaining something. 
Anyways, have a good day and stay safe.",g5ig60,fo4as4n,2020-04-21 20:32:06

I am just an engineer and a mom but there’s two things I would try with my kids (one is a picker).  First reward not picking.  Even if it’s just for one minute or five minutes at first (set a timer).  This has been really powerful for us.  Before you do something you enjoy, set a timer for five minutes and don’t pick.  Just reset the timer without judgement if you do pick.  Then enjoy your reward.  Can also do small things like listening to a certain song or having a small piece of chocolate.  

Second, you recognize your triggers already.  Decide what you want instead.  When I quit smoking I made a list of things I don’t associate with smoking like showering and grocery shopping and I quickly did one of those things instead.  Retrain your subconscious.

"I’m Dr. Jud, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Brown University. I have over 20 years of experience with mindfulness training, and I’m passionate about helping people treat addictions, form new habits and make deep, permanent change in their lives.","I recommend *The Easy Way to Stop Smoking.* People get different things out of that book, but what stood out to me personally was: 

1) People addicted to substances like heroin are not able to sleep when trying to quit. Yet most smokers have no problem with their sleep routine. Why doesn't cigarette addiction keep them up? And if it doesn't, how bad is it really? 
2) This isn't in Carr's own words, but I'll say it how I see it: We've been taught that it's hard to quit smoking, even through anti-smoking campaigns. But if you think about it, it's that reasoning that rewards both cigarettes and quitting aids. With cigarettes, people don't even bother trying to quit because they think it's this impossible task. With quitting aids, people think they need them because this task would be almost impossible otherwise. So if both sides are incentivized to convince people that it's hard to quit, wouldn't you say it's possible that the difficulty is actually over-exaggerated? 

I'll say this. The book helped me reframe my relationship with cigarettes primarily through those two points. Other points stick out to other people. That's what makes the book effective. It has this nice mix of facts, anecdotes, and learnings that just chip away at how you perceive cigarettes. You start actually questioning, ""Is it actually hard to quit smoking, or have I just been trained to believe that it's hard and sabotaged myself in the process?""

After reading that book, I quit cold turkey fairly easily. So either the book has a point, that it's actually not that hard to quit smoking and society has just made it seem that way, or the book is very good at mentally convincing people that it's easy to quit even if it isn't. Either way, it worked for me. So give it a shot!

PS. Another bonus tip derived from the book when I was dealing with the withdrawal. You'll feel dizzy when trying to quit at first. Think of it as a good thing: your brain's perception of your body getting more oxygen. That was always the least pleasant symptom for me, but with reframing, even that wasn't so bad.",g5ig60,fo3okv6,2020-04-21 17:32:53

"Finally got a breast reduction I’ve been waiting for, and here’s my experience","Better late than never. Congratulations. A few things. I know you are young but every surgery is impact to your body. Please request physical therapy. They don’t do that by default but it makes a difference. You don’t notice it right away but the motion of your arms become limited over time and affects pain. Also scar tissue is better when it is worked on to break it down. 

I had a different breast surgery and now when I lift my arms above my head I get dizzy cause they are so tight. I thought it was just me then my friend who had breast reduction said the same thing. Her arms aren’t flexible. I noticed later on other women go through the same thing. You are young so your body will snap back faster but even a short period of physical therapy makes a huge difference. I would also like to point out exercise and physical therapy are two different things. Your back could benefit from the PT as well.

"Finally got a breast reduction I’ve been waiting for, and here’s my experience","Congratulations! I had a breast reduction a few years ago and it has literally been the best thing I ever did for myself. Not only will the weight on your chest be less, but that neck and back pain should be a thing of the past too. 

For me, before the surgery, I yoyo'd with my weight big time. After, I take better care of myself and my weight has remained stable because I will do anything to keep my boobs perky and smaller! 

The only problem I had was under my arms where they pulled the skin back. It made a little point on both sides. They called it a dog ear but to me, it looked like the edge of an envelope that didn't get glued down. I had them removed in the office (so only an office visit co-pay). 

Make sure you take an extra t-shirt and a soft bra for your follow up. They put this funky fishnet bra thing on that is not comfy. I made my husband take off his undershirt and give it to me so I could wear something other than my shirt. And if you are on pain pills ... get off them as soon as you can because around week two, you'll start to feel a LOT better but it's an illusion. I was back doing my mall walking in week two with a friend (we walked there every day before the surgery). We got separated and I was lost. Literally lost. I just rode the escalator, crying on the phone that I didn't know where I was, until he came back and found me. Then, the next day, I drove to Home Depot alone and was gone for four hours but I thought it was only an hour or so. My husband was FRANTIC. Those pills make you think you're better than you are and that is a bad thing in your recovery. 

I'm in the US and it was pretty simple. Get the referral to the plastic surgeon from your primary care doctor, see the plastics, they do the legwork with insurance and then you're scheduled in the next six months. Your weight has to be stable in that time. 

So happy for you!",hx463z,fz447p7,2020-07-24 18:02:54
"Finally got a breast reduction I’ve been waiting for, and here’s my experience","Kinesiology/Sports Med Doc here. PT is a great suggestion. Your upper and mid back and the muscles that connect to your shoulder blade are going to have to re-learn how to keep you upright. Rowing exercise is crucial for women with large breasts and can decrease low back pain when done correctly. A good PT can get you a home exercise program that will be maintenance for years to come. Keeping the skin/front of body musculature from tightening down post-op is vital.

My wife had a similar situation and they refused to take enough off during her first surgery, which has created a return of pain with pregnancy. 800g is a lot, good for you.

Sending positive thoughts/prayers for your recovery. Congratulations on getting back some control of your body.

She seemed to briefly appreciate that idea.

I've gained a lot of weight and my husband finally commented on it.,"My boyfriend has gained some weight, and honestly, I haven't even really noticed. He's still the goofy, adorable person I love, and even if his belly is bigger, the passion we have together is still there. If you love someone, a change in their appearance really isn't a big deal. You're still attracted to them and you definitely still want to be intimate with them. 

My boyfriend has also been more insecure, too, and it's frustrating. I understand where your husband is coming from. If he wants you, he wants you. Don't reject him just because you're self conscious. Have a good time. Relieve some of that stress. ",aq1cmp,egcrft8,2019-02-13 02:29:34

I’ve been there so I totally get it, but even the memory of being that unhappy is painful.

LOVE YOURSELVES PEOPLE!!! It took years to finally feel comfortable in my own skin, and counseling definitely made a difference. I got out of a toxic relationship, focused on self care and being healthy (not just trying to loose weight) and I feel more like myself than I have in years. In the end it was about getting back my sense of self. My weight has fluctuated since and I’m unfortunately back at the higher end (due to a prescription change), but I keep remembering how much I used to hate myself at this same weight and it’s just NOT worth it to be that miserable again. Somehow I’m happy and comfortable in my skin (most of the time), because it has nothing to do with the numbers. It makes me happier realizing that I just don’t give a shit if my new bf sees my chub/flab while I walk around naked. Being self-conscious only ever makes me miserable and hate myself...I’d rather be happy and not have to wear pants.

I've gained a lot of weight and my husband finally commented on it.,"It's hard to lose your youthful self. Male or female, it's hard. 

Just keep doing what you're doing and telling her she is gorgeous. She will come to terms with her current body (or not). That's all you can do. We all grow old, and are not 19 forever. Fat or not. It's hard for everyone. 

What NOT to do: don't bust out the ""Well you're fat and unattractive now"" ammo when your seeing-red furious at her, knowing it's The Nuke Button. Feel free to think it, just don't say it. Say it, and she will never forget that moment. 

Don't belittle her efforts to work out. This is the big struggle I have with my husband. I gained weight after having thyroid cancer and other issues, and we are now middle aged. I spent the last two years solid spending at least an hour walking every night. He still will roll his eyes and be like ""You should be running."" Cool. That makes me feel super good. Thanks. Yeah, don't do that. If she institutes a work out regimen, even low impact, just encourage it. Don't tell her how much harder it should be. 

ETA: I don't mean to imply you would say or do these things. But that's me and my pudgy butt's experience with a guy who is 99% of the time supportive and chill. But, of course, it's the 1% one remembers. Well. I do. Not him so much. ",aq1cmp,egd7i4z,2019-02-13 06:29:41
I've gained a lot of weight and my husband finally commented on it.,"Honestly I don’t know what you can say specifically, but being reassuring and patient helps. Don’t be shy about compliments either. Being confident in what your telling her, as opposed to wary of her mood, will communicate volumes. Also hopefully the compliments don’t only come when she’s talking down about herself. Unprompted compliments often mean more...like a happy surprise! I know my ex only bought me flowers after a fight, so despite loving flowers the association was less meaningful.

Lastly she may need to work on self care (which is more about loving yourself than just working out or spa days), but counseling may be the best bet. Talking it out with a neutral third party may help her realize that although her body’s changed, she can still be happy and comfortable in her own skin. Good luck!

I've gained a lot of weight and my husband finally commented on it.,"Both my fiance and I have had weight ups and downs over the past decade since we started dating. Honestly, the changes are so incremental over time that I don't notice he's gaining or losing weight until his clothes stop fitting one way or the other. I'm sure it's the same with me. I remember he did lose a lot of weight a few years ago (and has gained it back since), and it wasn't until I was looking at old photos of us that I really realized just how much weight he'd lost (mainly around his stomach and face). He was attractive when we first met and he was heavier. He was attractive when he was thinner. He's still attractive after gaining that weight back. He just goes from various levels of huggable - like normal huggable to extra huggable. What always gets me is how he shakes his hands when he gets super excited or how the corners of his eyes crinkle when he smiles super big.

I don't know if my fiance finds me more attractive at a particular weight because everyday he tells me I'm beautiful. The only time he ever brought up my weight was when I would criticize myself, and he would gently remind me that I'm beautiful at any size - body, mind, and heart.

You have to decide whether the relationship is important enough for you both to grapple with this but in most cases I don't try to deal with other people's insecurities. There's not much YOU can do to fix it because it's about how she views herself.",1m9264b,n544l31,2025-07-25 16:41:59

You're legitimately worried about him, so you thought lashing out at him was the way to go? Asshole is actually too kind a word. If you care at all about him (which, honestly, it doesn't sound like you do), sit him down and explain that you are really worried about him. Talk about getting him into some sort of therapy. Also, get some counseling for yourself on how to deal with someone grieving because you suck at it.",15n2h3a,jvjnrwc,2023-08-10 05:00:20

‘Honey, I’m really worried that you’re not coping well after your Mom’s death. I would love to help you find a grief counselor or support group to help you find healthier coping mechanisms and process your grief’: what a normal, loving spouse says.

AITA for telling my husband that he needs to get himself under control?,"YTA - My mother’s death was incredibly difficult for many reasons which were out of my control. Due to the stress, self-imposed guilt, and heartache I literally had a mental breakdown. I tried to keep it together for about 3 months while I silently spiraled and it wasn’t until I almost ended my life that I admitted to my loved  ones how bad things were and got help. I had to take a leave of absence from my job, counseling and psychological therapy, etc. before I was finally able to heal enough to function in society again. 

The fact that your husband is still struggling means he needs help, not you judging him and telling him to get his stuff together. His eating is a symptom not a new hobby. His reaction, to pull farther away from you and become more isolated at your words, is worrisome. People deal with things differently and in different time frames.",15n2h3a,jvjoz49,2023-08-10 05:12:45

That was not a talk lady, that was you telling him what he should be doing and getting on his probably depressed ass about him gaining weight. Where is the concern about how he's feeling? Maybe focus on what he is going through rather than what you feel about it.

My dad died when I was 12, I’m now 28 and literally just discovering some ways that the lingering, unaddressed trauma from that might still be impacting me today, 16 years later. You expect him to be over the death in 5 months? 

The grieving process does not move on your schedule. It is not linear. It often does not make sense. There will be times years from now where he’s fine in his day to day life but he sees something or smells cooking that reminds him of her and suddenly he’s right back there in his grief.

But you don’t care about any of that. If you did, you would be showing concern for his well-being mentally instead of disgust at his weight. If you cared you would suggest he see a therapist, instead of being vile and hurtful.

OP, sorry but YTA on this occasion because of how you handled it. Your husband has very recently lost the one person who he could count on for support and unconditional love his whole life.

Essentially you have berated him for an issue he is going to be blatantly aware of already. He is feeling totally lost right now and by you saying what you did in that way has just made it feel to him that ‘nobody understands’ and emphasises what he has lost.

You need to choose your words and have  a conversation with him. I agree he needs help but  criticism without care isn’t the way.",15n2h3a,jvjze64,2023-08-10 07:11:22

AITA for telling my husband that he needs to get himself under control?,"THANK YOU. The number of times I read, ""Well, I mean, get over it"" after someone dies is astounding. There is no time frame on death and grief of any kind. 

I lost my grandfather - who raised me in lieu of an actual biological father who had abused the living shit out of me - on August 9th, 1999, right before I went to college, and when I was still only 17. That was 24 years ago, as of yesterday. And what did I do yesterday because I was so crushed, and am still doing a bit now?

Cried. Ate a pint of ice cream. Blasted loud, angry rock music and sang while painting a sign for the outside of my house. Looked at a few photos. Told my Kiddo and husband a few stories that I remembered. And both Kiddo (who is 11 1/2) and my husband were supportive, loving, and kind. 24 years, and I still mourn this man to the point that my jaw clenches and I get physically ill and I shake. 24 years, and my family says, ""We love you. We support you. Yeah, we're glad you have some goddamned therapy tomorrow because you still need it, but fuck all, we love you, so you do what you need to do today. We have this. Take your time.""

Because that is what loving people do.

OP, maybe he isn't coping well. But it's been months; not even decades, but months. You don't need to infantalize him or nitpick his current habits - you can simply talk to him, spouse to spouse, and express your love and worry. This is not about you; don't begin to frame it that way (such as, ""So, I see you're eating a fuckload of Taco Bell, and you better cut that out now, you're getting fat and you know it because I'm telling you!""). Be there as he processes this pain. There is no planned time for ""moving on."" Part of him might not. But he can have support and love. Instead, you came at this from a different place, and even if there is worry within that place, the way you said what you said means YTA.",15n2h3a,jvk9ahc,2023-08-10 09:19:10
AITA for telling my husband that he needs to get himself under control?,"Definitely. This was my immediate thought reading this. He's obviously not coping well mentally, so surely having a go at him is the most effective form of approach (/s) 

I lost my dad when I was 16, and it took me a lot longer than 6 months to fully recover from it. Perhaps if somebody had recognised the signs and I'd been offered help, I might have learned to deal sooner. 

The guy obviously needs some help, whether that be counselling or support.

How did you improve your relationship with food?,"Over the  last few years, I have lost and gained weight. Didn't realize this up until a few months back that my weight gain and loss has nothing to do with the diet and workout but more to do with my relationship with food and how I view it.

I stress eat a lot, my way of getting away with emotions is eating. 

I eat my emotions away, all those comments about my weight have lead to more binging that restricting, it affects me in a different way.

"The “relationship with food” narrative is a scam, and we have been gaslit for years","I am so tired of hearing about “healing your relationship with food.” Food is not a person. There is no relationship to fix. Yet for years, people with obesity have been told by thin dietitians and mental health professionals that we are just thinking about food the wrong way.

I believed it. I ate to full hunger and satiety, I went through “extreme hunger”. I tried therapy. I practiced intuitive eating. I journaled about my feelings toward food.

[DISCUSSION] The United States has a strange relationship with food.,"Hello everyone! My name is Andrew, I'm a 20's-something game developer from the United States and I am currently in Berlin for work. I head back home on Wednesday, but since I've been here I've noticed something about the culture around food here that is so marginally different from that in the US that I felt like sharing.

#The United States has a strange relationship with food

I will never not appreciate how convenient food is in the US. From roadside restaurants and fast food to 24/hr grocery stores and popular fast-at-home food options; the United States food culture is all about filling you up fast and getting you on your way at any time during the day. I have learned it is both the greatest and WORST thing in the world.

***Let me explain:***

I was once told that Americans have a weird relationship with food; we don't treat it the way we should. We eat food NOT as an activity, but as an idle behavior.

•Watching TV - Eat

•Playing games - Eat

•Driving - Eat

•Working - Eat

•Doing literally nothing - Eat

We eat and snack at nearly every time in the day. It's not *SECTIONED OFF* at all. Eating food isn't respected enough to have its own place in our daily schedule; it is thrown into the mix with 500 other things. Food is only there so that we can either continue to live or to busy ourselves with something to do.

But here in Berlin it is totally different. Restuarants don't even OPEN until like Noon at the EARLIEST. The restaurants near me open at frickin' 4:00 PM for crying out loud. Resturants that aren't even strictly dinner type restaurants still open at a later time in the day. There are no fast food places nearby. I've yet to see a SINGLE ONE this entire time. I know there is a McDonalds a few kilometers away from me, but in a dense city, a few kilometers might as well be 15 miles.

All restaurants here either have you go in and sit down or take it with you. ALSO restaurants don't have parking either. You either walk/bike there or use public transportation (which also involves walking). It's an active process to go out and get food, not an idle one.

The grocery stores are the same exact way. I've been to three just to look around. Two of them are out on the streets with no parking (just like restaurants) and the final one was on the top story of a 3 story tall mall. There wasn't even a snack isle, there was a snack corner with hardly anything. The frozen foods section COMBINED was smaller than one frozen isle at Walmart. However, their freshly baked bread, produce, and home cooking ingredients areas literally made up the rest of the grocery store. In the US that would be unheard of.

#It's so strange when you take this and compare it to how we acquire food in America

We have fast food EVERYWHERE, and driving is so normal in the US that a short drive to McDonald's is always worth it. On top of that, most places are so far apart here you HAVE to drive. Everyone has a car, so public transportation is nonexistent.

Furthermore, sit-down restaurants are not only less common, but WIDELY more expensive. Here in Berlin all restuarant have pretty competitive prices. I got a large pizza yesterday for like $8.50 and it was baked in a stone oven and the ingredients were either fresh or hand crafted right there. In the US that is unheard of, but $5 quickly made pizzas are on every block.

Grocery stores are different too. The layouts and options at stores in the US, even at stores considered ""healthy"" or ""natural"", are laughable compared to the stores I have seen here. Freshly baked breads, freshly cut meats, fresh produce, and home cooking ingredients usually reside in the same corner of the store. EVERYWHERE ELSE is frozen foods, snacks, or other unhealthy options. Endcaps and other displays in the walking lanes of grocery stores are commonly unhealthy and fast-food-type meals you likely would use a microwave for.

#Closing off

We have such an awkward relationship with food in the US it is no wonder everyone struggles with weight. It's not just WHAT you are eating, but the entire process of it.

•WHAT you are eating

•HOW you are eating

•WHEN you are eating

•ACQUIRING food for eating.

It's all so different that it's insane to even compare them. I'm excited to return to my fridge of frozen meals and my fast food restaurants, but now that I truly see how other people treat food, I want to jump on that and try some of that behavior for myself.

Thanks for reading!

#TL;DR

The US treats food as an idle behavior rather than an activity. It blends together with other things we do during the day, and even WHEN we eat, our selections of food are almost always of unhealthy variety.",drvyh0,n/a,2019-11-05 07:37:06
American advertising normalizes an abnormally unhealthy relationship with food.,"I was washing dishes the other night and saw this ad come on tv, basically suggesting that even though you’ve already brushed your teeth for the night, you should just disregard that and have a late night Reese’s and brush again later. [Weird Reese’s Ad](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D0wjgr1_1f8)

It got me to thinking about how that’s not normal healthy behavior. I don’t think normal healthy people get ready for bed, then decide, “nah, let’s eat some candy right before going to sleep, even though I’ve already brushed my teeth.” I understand that the commercial may be in jest, but it suggests that idea, anyway. And I wonder, how many other messages are whispered in our ears that makes us think these bad decisions are okay, or even normal?

It reminds me of a Little Debbie ad I heard on the radio, where the speaker basically said you deserve to treat yourself, then came up with the flimsiest excuses to reward yourself with a Little Debbie (you got up out of bed I think was one example). 

Even if it’s using humor to sell a product, I still think it’s helpful to reconsider advertising from an objective perspective to think about how it may affect your behavior. I used to binge on sweets in the worst way, and even now I have to keep them completely out of the house to avoid the temptation, because I understand that I cannot have a normal relationship with that type of food. Have there been any outside influences that have made you think certain unhealthy eating habits were “normal?”",iuapxm,n/a,2020-09-17 02:43:30
AITA for eating ice cream every night just like I always do and not stopping just bc my SIL doesn't want my niece to see it?,"Most nights after dinner, I eat a small ice cream cone. It’s literally the little “joy mini cups” with a teeny scoop of ice cream. Maybe a big scoop if I’m having a rough day but that’s kinda rare. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke weed or do anything “fun” so this is my one fun thing I do for myself. 

My brother and his wife and daughter are staying with me for a few weeks, they’ll be gone by June 15. I’m happy to have them here. Usually we’ll eat dinner together and go our separate ways for the evening. They watch a lot of TV so they’re usually all in the living room watching. 

I’ve been eating my lil cone, but my sister in law approached me and asked me if I could stop. She said that my niece is starting to ask why she doesn’t get to have ice cream and that obviously she was lied to by my sister in law when she told her ice cream is a sometimes food, haha. 

I said that I wasn’t going to stop but I could wait until she was in bed. I figured that was a good compromise and I do get that she’s trying to raise her little girl to have a healthy relationship with food. But waiting until she was in bed didn’t work because she came into the kitchen multiple times to ask me for some. 

My SIL was definitely a little incredulous over it and kept saying “Really? Do you seriously NEED to eat ice cream every single day?” or stuff like it. I said no, but she also doesn’t need to drink a glass of wine every day either. She didn’t like this and sighed a bunch and has been visibly annoyed with me since then. My brother asked me if I could stop just to avoid the drama, but I said I deserve my little treats. AITA?

  
**Hi so I've decided to log off this post and not come back.** This post has just gotten completely out of control with really over the top overreactions and people trying to encourage me to make things worse or escalate and call my sil an alcoholic or to purposely eat more ice cream in front of my niece. Some of you are just like chomping at the bit to call people names and be sarcastic and nasty to me for no reason. That's not really what I was expecting and we're not allowed to delete posts so I'm just going to log out and move on. ",1kxi2yw,n/a,2025-05-28 14:10:24

I'm thankful for the advancement and know it works. However, is it truly long-term sustainable? I feel like I'm exchanging mental weight for physical weight sometimes. Has anyone else experienced this? Have you discovered a more healthful method to maintain your diet without developing a food obsession?

AITA for blowing up at my parents for something my adult sister did?,"I (26F) have a sister, “Amy” (28F), who has always had a difficult relationship with food. She was bullied as a kid and turned to food for comfort. As an adult, she still struggles with self-control, especially around things she finds appetizing. Our parents have never set boundaries with her around food, and that’s carried into adulthood—she currently lives with them, and they do all the grocery shopping and cooking.

My husband (28M) recently had a birthday, and I planned a surprise party. I sent him out of the house for a few hours so I could set up and asked my parents to come help. I specifically asked them not to bring Amy setting up involved putting out snacks, drinks, and a homemade cake with frosting.

They showed up with Amy anyway, saying it wouldn’t be fair to exclude her. I gave her a few small tasks and specifically asked her not to touch any of the food until guests arrived, but I was too busy to keep a constant eye on her.

At one point, I went into the kitchen and found Amy with the fridge open, eating the frosting out of the mixing bowl. She had eaten nearly half of it. As soon as she saw me, she burst into tears and said she only meant to try a little but couldn’t stop.

My parents heard us and came in. My mom said it wasn’t that big of a deal since the cake was untouched and I still had enough frosting for a crumb coat, but I had planned to do specific cake decorations, and now there wasn’t enough frosting; I didn’t have the time or ingredients to make more. My dad suggested going to the store to buy a tub of pre-made frosting, saying it was the same thing. I explained my husband tries to avoid a lot of the ingredients found in store-bought frosting and wouldn’t want that. My dad said to just not tell him since he “wouldn’t even know the difference“. 

That suggestion was super frustrating to me. I told my parents that they couldn't convince me that this was no big deal, and that they had allowed this by not setting boundaries with Amy’s binge eating and by bringing her to set up. They told me to back off and be more sensitive to my sister, and that it wasn’t her fault. I responded by saying that I was more angry at them, because at least Amy felt bad while they were trying to downplay the situation. 

They got upset and said it wasn’t fair to blame them for Amy’s choices, and that she was an adult and they can’t control her. They also said that they were trying to help by giving suggestions, and that I was being stubborn by shutting all of them down. They ended up leaving, and now they’re giving me the silent treatment, even though Amy has apologized for eating the frosting. AITA for involving them in this?",1l2j2zu,n/a,2025-06-03 18:11:03
AITA for “forcing” my wife to eat,"My wife (28F) and I (29M) have been married for a year, together for six. Over that time, I’ve gotten really concerned about her eating habits, and it's starting to cause some serious friction. 

She literally just doesn't seem to enjoy food at all. She'll say stuff like, ""I wish we didn't have to eat to survive and we could just choose if we wanted to go out to a fun restaurant. It would be for like a hobby."" She also just straight up tells me she doesn't like food and she’s never hungry. 

The biggest issue is that she'll only eat dinner because I'm home to make sure she does. During the day, she'll just forget to eat or avoid it entirely. Even at dinner, she's super particular about what she'll eat. And if I’m not home for dinner, she again will not eat. I’ve seen her hiding food in the trashcan that she said that she ate. It’ll be an excuse like she had a few bites and got full, but I don’t think she even took bites. Don’t even get me started with her not eating breakfast.

When I try to talk to her about it, she gets defensive. I’ve brought up the possibility of an eating disorder, but she shuts it down immediately, saying she's fine because she weighs 140 pounds and is 5’5”.  (The weight she says she is.)

It's gotten to the point where I feel like I have to force her to eat, and it just turns into a fight. She gets mad at me, and I feel like an asshole for causing these arguments. But I'm just so worried about her health. I don't know what to do.

And maybe I wouldn’t be so worried if she wasn’t on the treadmill for like three hours a day without fueling her body. It’s not three hours constantly. It’s just going to the basement several times to get on the treadmill.

Should I keep “forcing” her to eat, even though it's causing us to fight? Or should I just let her do what she wants. She would go for days without eating if I didn’t say anything.

Edit to answer the question if anything has happened or changed. She was sexually assaulted by our drunken exfriend at a party that was about six or seven months ago. He kept grabbing her butt and she said she mentally blacked out which is why she only walked away and didn’t say anything to him. It happened three times total in that night. I sent him a nasty text and he admitted to knowing what he did. I reached out to other friends, letting them know what happened and that we would no longer be around if he OR his wife were invited. (Who was one of her close friends and never reached out) Which is a horrible situation, i’ve tried asking if she wants to go to therapy she says she’s fine, so I don’t know if that’s contributing to this.

Ever since dating she’s had a weird relationship with food, but it’s definitely gotten worse over the last year I would say. She is also not on any medication and refers to her mom as an almond mom. 

Update: I made her get on the scale in front of me I know it’s harsh but has opened my eyes. She’s at 116.",1mewjek,n/a,2025-08-01 13:29:58
Anyone else have messed up relationships with food now?,"I remembered recently a time when I was very young, around 6ish, and both of my parents worked, but my dad worked from home so he would be in charge of us (me bro and sis) for the day while she was out. On the days mum was out, we wouldn't get any food until she came back because dad was too busy to sort any food out for us. I remember being hungry a lot as a kid. As an adult I eat at weird times, go long periods without eating and then eat way too much at once. Not sure I can blame my dad entirely but I reckon there's something there.",qvxu0b,n/a,2021-11-17 12:04:26
Anyone else feel like calorie tracking is low-key ruining their relationship with food?,"I’ve been using different apps for the past year, and while I’ve definitely learned a lot, I sometimes catch myself obsessing over numbers more than how I actually *feel* after eating. Like, I know awareness is key, but is there a point where tracking becomes… counterproductive?

Curious if anyone else has found a better balance or maybe even ditched calorie counting altogether and still made progress? ",1jjis4u,n/a,2025-03-25 13:00:23
"Did you grow up in a household where you could be punished for going into the food, doing so at certain times, etcetera? If so, how did that impact your relationship with food throughout your life?","This question got kicked out of the ask old people sub for being unsuitable. However, I think it's a good question.
I was born in 81 and anything edible was off limits unless it was expressly given to you. These days, I'm both overweight and exceedingly picky.

I'm conflicted because a lot of kids will just eat because it's there or they're bored. When money is tight, it's tricky. Yet the ability to eat when hungry is something that should be a basic right--especially in a first-world nation.

AITAH for calling the ambulance for my co-worker even though I know she was kind of faking it?,"**I am NOT the Original Poster. That is** [Normal\_Midnight1661](https://www.reddit.com/user/Normal_Midnight1661/). He posted in r/AITAH

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kmzdep/aitah_for_calling_the_ambulance_for_my_coworker/)**: May 14, 2025**

I (28M) am working in an English language center in a Southeast Asian country. There's a female co-worker in her 20s here who often touches her head and wobbles like she was about to faint, and she would lie down on the couch, letting people fan her, bring water and food to her. We take midday naps here, so whenever she does this, everyone's lunch and nap time is ruined, especially the ones who keep caring for her.

This would happen at least twice a month, so over the last 5 or 6 months, I've seen a few incidents when we worked the same shift. One time she even asked me to order ice cream for her. (info, it's a big, crowded city, so you can just walk to the ice cream shop nearby to grab one for a dollar). Didn't pay me back, but that's beside the point.

This Monday, she did it again, and this time she asked a girl to order her an iced drink, a sandwich. A group of co-workers fanned her, did the whole caring thing like she's a sick child.

I stood up from my chair, walked towards her, asked if she was OK, then I went to the men's washroom, dialed for an ambulance and went back to my seat. After 20 minutes, we heard the siren, my phone rang again, and I stood up and told her ""servants"" to help her to the ambulance.

Her face CHANGED, you know, that face, when someone knows they fked up, other girls asked if I called, I said yeah, it seems more severe this time. It's best for her to go. The ambulance is here already, you'll have to pay for it regardless (the ambulance fee is about 1-2 days worth of her salary, \~50 dollars). Other coworkers actually agreed and helped her get on the ambulance. Now that I think of it, no one called an ambulance for her once.

Ever since that incident, she stopped interacting with me beyond hi's and hello's (Thursday now, not a word to me). AITAH for this?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: NTA. Thanks for a funny story!

>**OOP:** Half of me thinks it's funny but half of me feels guilty because she propably paid 2 days worth of her salary on the ambulance.

Commenter: She probably hadn't been paying anyone else back for things like drinks and food. So I figure the fee for the ambulance was her AH tax. :)

>**OOP:** Oooh I should dm other coworkers to see if she's paid them back. It's just a dollar or two though.

Commenter: I'm gonna disagree with everyone here, YTA, ambulances are meant to save lives and not deal with petty squabbles. That said, from the title alone I would have agreed with you, as you don't know if someone is faking or not, but you have deliberately hid the fact that you're calling for it, didn't ask her if it's needed etc. Also I would like to point out that, while she does seem to be faking it and in general acts like an asshole, her reaction to the ambulance could be due to the cost, so it is no proof of faking it

>**OOP:** Which is why I posted. I secretly called so she couldn't disagree to it. Maybe she's actually not faking it and it is of a sensitive topic (severe menstruation as some people suggested). But you can't deny that she's been abusing it a little bit. Turned out some co-workers havent get their money back yet from buying her stuff as she demanded too. *\[editor's note- these comments are chronological, so OOP dmed the coworkers between answering the last comment and this one\]*

Commenter: Damn this is something I actually want an update on.

After that incident did she stop her faking for a bit? Did she continue? I feel like if she stopped for a bit, you should tell your coworkers the ambulance trick worked n they need to do it. Every time you see her you should be annoying n just ask if she is feeling okay! lol

>**OOP:** It's only been 4 days. Usually she acts up every 2 weeks, sometimes once a week but in a milder way. Tired, headaches, etc. Not fully laying on the couch.  
It'sa small update but I texted 2 girls a turned out she hasnt paid them back food money, but they're teachers so they said it didn't bother them. My workplace is very nice and peaceful otherwise.

Commenter: Curious how you know she is faking it?

>**OOP:** Just a hunch really. People in pain and people faking pain look different. It's the subtle details that I cannot really explain. It looks forced/exaggerated (?)  
I might be talking out of my ass here but I imagine if someone is in pain and groaning, they would sweat, heat up, or go pale (?), again. IDK, but it feels weird when you see it.

Commenter: Sorry, but that’s just not evidence. Everyone reacts to things and shows things differently. Just because you wouldn’t react like that doesn’t mean she wouldn’t. An example is seizures. They often look very different to how people would expect. On TV they’re always exaggerated jerking and shaking. Sometimes they can look like that, but sometimes people go stiff and completely still, sometimes it’s tiny like a small muscle contraction, sometimes it looks like zoning out. So if you saw someone zoning out instead of jerking around would you say they were faking it?

Or people react differently to stress. Some people cry. But other people laugh. Would you not believe them because they’re not reacting how you would?

You have no idea of this woman’s history. Maybe she is faking it? Why do you need to be the one to stop it? The people looking after her have minds of their own and you just don’t have enough evidence if it’s based on a hunch. The ambulance you called was malicious and just to prove a point and teach her a lesson. But you don’t know for 100% if she has a medical condition or not. Maybe she does and it is managed by the things you say people help her with. You cannot do that to someone on a “hunch”.

>**OOP:** I agree with your view. Maybe a few more days I'll try to ask about her hospital visit in a polite way.

Commenter: ETA. I say this as a personal with chronic illness. Faking obviously sucks. However, I wouldn't want anyone to call an ambulance without my premision if I struggled with my chronic illnesses. Eventhogh, the ambulance is free here. Would still annoy me. I am not dying. I faint quite often and have some other issues. I usually sit down, drink some water, and maybe get someone to watch if it gets bad.

Emergency services are meant for emergencies, not for being petty. You just waisted their time.

>**OOP:** I agree. Was petty of me to bother the hospital. But other than that I don't know what else to do. Confronting her, texting her, talking to other co-workers behind her, staying silent all seem wrong.

Commenter: I used to get fainting spells for that reason, and eating a bit and drinking some water would usually help me feel *better* (but not cured, obviously), so that's what I would go for when it happened. Took about 6 years to get diagnosed.

Everyone making a big fuss probably isn't helping the coworker feel better, and OP should probably have gone for ""You should go home"" before calling an ambulance (honestly I found it difficult to believe that an ambulance would come unless OP lied to them - they certainly wouldn't have in England).

>**OOP:** Here, caller provides name, phone number, ID, answer some questions, and ambulance will come. The phone number must match the one registered on your ID.  
The patient will be charged digitally through their ID scan or by cash, bank transfer or by a tag-along person. I know this because I went with a relative by ambulance when he got stomachache.

Commenter: Sorry, I'm just stuck on the fee. Is it $50? And is $50 1-2 days of her pay?

>**OOP:** Yeah, southeast asian country. Ambulance is cheap, but salary is also low compared to the US. Actually, most of my foreign relatives book flights to Vietnam for medical care. Diabetes and such. Insulin is cheap here.  
*To another commenter:*  
Vietnam. Far location is 50, near hospital is 25 actually.

**Mini Update in Comments: May 15, 2025 (Next Day)**

Oooh I've been asking around. Apparently Miss Faint haven't paid some of the co-workers back their food money, borrowed money from a few people, and asked to ""have a bite"" of some people's food. I'm added to a private group chat with 5 other coworkers. I will give update later, today was a lot for me at work.

*Another comment:*

We made a group chat and provided a lot of proof last night. This is an HR problem now and we will notify HR instead of talking directly to her. She has been texting other coworkers and borrowing money to go to the hospital. She exclusively targets female teachers and requires them to not share the matter with others. This is beyond me now, will update after HR solve it.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kq6je3/update_aitah_for_calling_the_ambulance_for_my/)**: May 19, 2025 (4 days later, 5 from OG post)**

Here's the update on the female co-worker who kept ""fainting"" and asking people to order food for her. I'll call her Anne, because there's a lot of women involved in this update.

\- After the first post, I texted some female coworkers to see if they had received food money back. Two female teachers told me that they hadn't, but they didn't mind. The total amount was around 20 dollars per person.

\- Words got around fast, and I was added to a group of 5 OTHER people, so in total, at least 7 female teachers were affected by Anne.

\- Based on their word, Anne has low blood pressure and malnutrition, she indeed is very thin (Kpop idol type of body). She clearly has some unhealthy relationship with food. It's almost as if she doesn't want to pay for food.

\- She borrowed money from multiple female teachers to ""pay hospital bills"", and begged them to not disclose this information to others. We're talking up to a loan that worths FOUR MONTHS of salary. She basically borrowed half of that teacher's emergency funds.

\- She also flirted with one female teacher, said teacher often brings her on small dinner dates. I didn't ask on this matter.

\- HR was notified, the girls did the talking, I was called in as ""the one who called the ambulance"".

\- After the meeting, it's confirmed that Anne will be let go after 30 days, the reasoning was ""creating a hostile workplace environment"". This morning was really awkward.

\- Unfortunately, HR cannot help with the loans that people have given her, as it's personal matter. However, HR is willing to provide personal information of Anne to the affected coworkers. ?????? Oh well. It's their matter now.

Now, answering some comments from the previous post:

\- Some mentioned that I was wasting healthcare resources. Well, she was examined and came back with a diagnosis.

\- Some asked me why everything's so cheap. It's Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. Most things are affordable here except real estate lol. In fact, my overseas relatives literally book flights to Vietnam for medical care. Insulin here is like 3-7 dollars per vial and you can buy it at almost any public or private hospital. If you have national healthcare ID, it's basically free.

\- Some was worried for me because I accidentally slipped my personal social media page on the previous post. I don't really care honestly, I'm considered a valuable asset, and I'm easy to work with. If anything comes up, I think the company and I will be able to solve it peacefully. *\[editor's note- OOP had linked some tiktoks to people asking about the nap situation\]*

\- Yes, people take midday naps in Vietnam, you're the odd one if you don't. If I'm not standing a class, I'm allowed to be online, doing Tiktoks, etc. Having a Tiktok account is not a legal reason to be let go.

\- There's one Redditor here who was incredibly vindictive and was trying to antagonise me in the dms. Girl get a grip, you deliberately ignored all other comments. You're blocked. Byeeeeee.

And finally, don't lend your coworkers half of your emergency funds. ????? Like whyyyy.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Damn that’s just *low* to prey on other women like that. Still NTA. You put an end to her abusing your coworkers’ kindness.

>**OOP:** TEACHERS no less. I literally work with the kindest angels.

Commenter: Thanks for the update - man what a wild ride! I like that your feedback of a prank on a pattern of bad behavior turned into this huge unmasking of the extent her harmful behavior!

NTA

Why diagnosis did they give her?

>**OOP:** Low blood pressure and malnutrition

Commenter: Is it possible she is supporting her parents or family and doesn’t have enough money for food for herself?

>**OOP:** Nah, she doesn't come across as someone who's in need. Her position offers good salary. I think she has a problematic relationship with food more than anything. Maybe a form of eating disorder.

Commenter: (downvoted) Calling an ambulance for a madeup emergency, is illegal for a reason. You wasted resources on an ambulance that could've been used for someone who actually needed it. Next time you want to make a point, do it in a way that doesn't potentially put someone's life in danger. 

>**OOP:** I don't know your location to judge the scarcity of ambulances, but in Vietnam, hospitals are a dime a dozen. One dispatched ambulance won't be a problem here. Plus, she made up the emergency, not me. I responded to the scene. Additionally, she was in fact clinically diagnosed and provided papers to HR. If it were you, what would you do. Remember this has been going for 6 months.",1kvxxp2,n/a,2025-05-26 15:58:15
The most interesting thing about Adult Misty as a character is her relationship with food.,"The woman just eats. All the time. Snacks. Candy. Cakes. Caramel cake. Meat. Strawberries.  Vegetables.

Misty takes revenge on the old lady for throwing perfectly good food on the floor.

She reminds me of Holocaust survivors who said they ate everything off the plate after it happened.

She cannot understand why Tai and Natalie would hate meat.

Her and Shauna might be besties in that sense.",1h297d0,n/a,2024-11-29 00:06:54
AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding? (A 1.5 years later update),"**I am NOT the Original Poster. That is** [ThrowRAgoldenbride](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRAgoldenbride/). She posted in r/AmItheAsshole

# Do NOT comment on Original Posts. Latest update is 7 days old. Long Post.

**Editor's note:** This was a complicated one to aggregate because OOP left so many comment. Many of them were super informative and helpful in understanding her perspective. They also answered a lot of questions people had. I tried to include only a few, but this did end up being a longer post.

**Trigger Warning:** >!OOP has narcissistic personality disorder; ableism; controlling behavior!<

**Mood Spoiler:** >!things are looking better!<

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pdwg0/aita_for_wanting_people_to_wear_white_at_my/)**: July 3, 2023**

So I'm (24F) having a hard time seeing where I went wrong, but me and my husband to be (26M) both struggle with NPD \[narcissistic personality disorder\] so I figured an outside opinion might be helpful, since neither of us tends to understand when we're wrong right away.

I'm getting married (yay!) in December to the absolute love of my life, and we both want it to be the most spectacular wedding the world has ever seen because we both really love attention. I never used to feel comfortable admitting that, but ever since I've been with him I've been able to really accept that, and it's made my life so much more \*fun.\* We decided that instead of having me in a white dress like all the other white dresses, and him in the same tuxedo as every man in attendance, it would look really spectacular if we both dressed head to toe in gold. What we want is for all our guests to wear either black, white, or grey, and for us to be the only ones wearing color. I figured that not only would I look like a princess, but I'd also be dancing with a prince instead of just some guy, and he's so into the idea that he remembers it as being his. We just love that idea of a sea of monochrome, and then us in the middle of it all.

The only thing is, my sister (26F) has been absolutely furious at us ever since the clothing requirements came out. First, she said this was ""proof that I never changed"" and I was being controlling again. Basically, that asking guests to wear a specific color was insane. Then she started making digs about my hair and how I was ""just doing this to show off"" and asked if I planned to have her dye her hair too (I did not, we're both blonde but mine is a bit more yellow-blonde, and my husband is dying his hair for the wedding). I admitted to that, but also pointed out that it's my wedding and it's normal. Then she accused me of trying to upstage everyone else's wedding dress, basically implying that I was trying to get everyone to show up in wedding dresses so I could compete with them and make myself look even better by comparison.

This was not ever the plan. When I mentioned what she said to my husband to be, his eyes kind of lit up in this really cute way and he said we should encourage people to actually wear their own wedding clothes, but we decided it would probably be actually terrible of us. We decided to let our families wear copper if they wanted, so they would stand out as a nice accent to gold, and then my sister would also get to stand out. I was totally willing to pay, and said as much. That was when she called me a spoiled child, and said she wasn't like me and wasn't in this for herself, and wanted all the guests to be able to wear ""normal wedding clothes"" and that nobody in their right mind would be comfortable wearing white to a wedding.

TL;DR: I want all my guests to wear black, white, or grey to my wedding, and my husband and I to wear gold. My sister thinks this is horrible and I'm making everyone feel uncomfortable. AITA?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: It sounds like a really pretty wedding. I don't think upstaging everyone who has ever had a wedding is the goal here, but I also think every person who has a wedding wants it to be special and memorable in their own way. Kinda weird your sister doesn't feel that way.

>**OOP:** She's really against events where I get attention. I get it, considering how I was before I knew I had NPD and how to handle it, but I guess I thought a wedding was an appropriate time to want attention, you know?

Commenter: Have you tried to make things right with her since your diagnosis? It can be a bit traumatizing to have any kind of relationship, familial or otherwise, with someone who has NPD.

>**OOP:** I have. We went to therapy together when I was 18, and since then, our relationship has been 100% on her terms. I really do want to make things right, and have been trying to for a long time.

Commenter: \[...\] I wonder if your sister is just kicking back because you're not having a traditional wedding and she's jealous of the attention you'll receive?

>**OOP:** She had a really traditional wedding last year, and I wasn't actually invited to that, so I don't know a lot of details, but I know she wasn't happy with how it went. I do think that my dress code is pretty simple, especially since, not to be macabre, but everyone has funeral clothes, right?

Commenter: NTA it's your wedding and this is your special day. If anyone has a problem with that they shouldn't come.

>**OOP:** I do want her there, though. Like, if I'm being unreasonable here, I'd rather know than not.

Commenter: Can i ask why you had been excluded from her wedding?

>**OOP:** Ever since I was 16, she hasn't wanted me at any events focused on her. She asked me to stay home for her highschool graduation, all her birthdays, her college graduation, and I couldn't meet her child until a week after either. We sometimes celebrate alone, but when we were growing up, I would do something to grab attention pretty often, at basically any event I was invited to. I've done a lot of growing up since then and apologized a bunch of times, but she still doesn't trust me.

Commenter: May i ask what you mean by stealing the spotlight? Was it on purpose or was it that you naturally draw attention

>**OOP:** It wasn't like it was malicious but it wasn't exactly not on purpose either. I just absolutely love when everyone is watching me, and I'm pretty good at a lot of things. On my sister's 17th birthday I ""gifted"" her a song I wrote (I got the idea from a tv show) and everyone spent the rest of the party saying how good I was, and that was one of the big things she brought up when she first banned me from her events. I honestly just loved the attention and it didn't occur to me that what I was doing took something away from her, because I figured everyone loved watching me so I was just making her parties better, and I thought she also loved watching me. I get it now, and I get that what I did was really wrong, but I didn't understand at the time.

Commenter: How in the world could you see nothing wrong with taking all the attention?

>**OOP:** I honestly didn't think I was doing anything bad. A lot of people liked watching me do things from when I was very young, and my dad always said that when I performed it made people happy. I always figured that, when I performed, I was making a party or event better for everyone, and I thought my sister also liked to watch me, and I loved it a lot. Everything seemed to reinforce that this was a good thing, and I never thought about it as taking something away from my sister.

Commenter: Sounds like you have a good amount of insight into your self-centredness and are trying to work on it. \[...\]

>**OOP:** Thank you. I'm doing my best to grow and be better than I used to be. I know I'll never not be a narcissist, but I'm trying to be more careful not to hurt the people around me or take attention away from other people's accomplishments.

Commenter (downvoted): NTA. Are you sure you have NPD and aren’t just the family scapegoat?

>**OOP:** I definitely have NPD. I just also have years of therapy and hard work under my belt, and a really supportive and wonderful partner who has allowed me to accept some things about myself and work on making them less of a detriment and more of a strength.

*Boundaries/therapy:*

>I'm in therapy! It's been a little tricky to have it be as consistent as I would like, but for now I am in every other week. I know I'll always be a narcissist, no matter what I do, and I want to still be able to have good relationships where I don't hurt or take things away from anyone. I've said something very similar to what you quoted a few times.  
Her boundaries are pretty simple. We only really meet up at either family gatherings, or one-on-one in a private space. If we meet one-on-one, I'm not allowed to talk about myself, my life, or anything I'm accomplishing or working on unless she specifically asks. At family events she'll be at, I need to send her what I'll be wearing ahead of time and have it be non-attention-seeking, and I can't perform (sing, dance, etc) or talk about anything I'm working on unless I ask her permission first, and if she says no I can't ask again. If she tells me she needs to vent, then I can't react or get upset about anything she says to me or tell anyone else about it. That's pretty much everything. It can be tricky at times, but I know that's mostly my disorder, and it's worth it to have her in my life.

Commenter: Sorry to comment on this post three times, but it’s really alarming me. She has to OK your outfits even if it’s an event that is not focused on her? You are not allowed to talk about yourself whatsoever without PERMISSION? I hope someone with more experience with N.PD can tell me if there is a healthy rationale behind this because I think you love your sister so much are not able to clearly see that she is controlling you and is frankly, really mean to you.

>**OOP:** I'm only not allowed to talk about myself at all when it's just us, and then I'm not supposed to ask for permission. When we're at family gatherings, I can talk about myself generally, like my relationships or music I like or anything, I just can't talk about goals or projects I'm working on or accomplishments of any kind without checking, because it's a form of attention seeking. Like, most recently, I had to check if she was okay with me talking about learning how to make pizza from scratch from my husband-to-be, but she said it was fine as long as I talked about the learning process and didn't, like, offer to teach anyone anything or say how great I was at it or anything.  
The outfits thing can be frustrating, especially since she almost always shoots down like three or four outfits before accepting something and it's usually way too hot, but it makes her feel way more comfortable so it's not the biggest deal ever.

*Attention:*

>It's more like... whenever everyone is paying attention to me, I just feel so, so happy, and it's like the best feeling in the world, and sometimes when nobody pays attention I feel... it's just horrible? It's like I feel like I only exist if someone is watching. When I'm alone, I barely even have any feelings. It's just all dull and meaningless. But yeah, it did accumulate in me stealing the spotlight when I shouldn't have. I thought, at the time, that what I was doing was good, because it *felt* right, and a lot of people really do love watching me perform. It didn't occur to me that I was taking something away from my sister. We did go to therapy when I was 18, which is when she put a lot of her boundaries in place.

Commenter: Think about it from your sister’s perspective. If 90% of the time you always had the attention that meant she didn’t and you are totally fine with her feeling horrible because you felt good. So everything, in your mind, is always about you and your desire to feel good. It doesn’t matter to you if no one else exists because only your existence matters?

>**OOP:** I have thought about that a lot in the past 8 years. Before that, I honestly thought that she didn't really like attention, especially not like I did. Main girls in books didn't like attention like I did, same on TV, most of my friends got things like stage fright or nerves talking to strangers that I never did. In my head, this was just how I was, and it seemed less than common.

Commenter: Out of curiosity what is your parents position after all this time, also the clothing thing is ridiculous and you should probably set a boundary on not needing permission

>**OOP:** My dad hates it, and always says it's ridiculous and tries to get me to perform or talk about myself or take off the coats or sweatshirts she makes me wear, and sometimes takes me inside so we can just hang out with people without my mom and sister and I can relax. My mom is very strict though, and says that the boundaries are important and that I abused my sister when we were growing up by stealing attention, so her and her trauma is the most important thing. She made it clear that if I ever refuse, I won't be allowed back at any family event she or my sister are attending. I know my mom and dad fight about it so I try not to bring it up, because I know they love each other and they were going to get divorced for a bit when the rules first started when I was sixteen.

*OOP reiterates:*

>She \[sis\] definitely doesn't dictate my life. I actually only see family maybe once a month, twice sometimes, and the rest of the time I get to be more myself. I still try to be more respectful, and not awful, but I actually love fashion and my hair and performing. My husband to be and I go to karaoke every week at least once, and I'm in a local musical right now!

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1huj9e2/update_aita_for_wanting_people_to_wear_white_at/)**: January 5, 2025 (1.5 years later)**

My husband and I just recently celebrated our first anniversary, and I was thinking about all the dress code drama when I remembered this account and thought it would be fun to give y'all a little one-year update!

After I made my original post, my husband and I decided to contact my sister and parents and have a sit-down discussion about the situation. He offered to take everyone out to eat, and we had this really long discussion about my sister and my relationship.

My sister said she made a promise to herself never to let that happen again, and that if I wanted her in my life, I needed to be a normal person. My husband told her that if she was going to keep humiliating me for something I did as a child, then she wasn't a normal person either. It became a bit chaotic. My dad took our side, and said my sister's taking things too far. My mom took my sister's side, and said that, since I have NPD, I'm not capable of real change and if they ever give in at all they'll be hurting my sister. It ended with my sister calling my father an enabler and threatening to cut him of. It wasn't a great dinner overall.

What surprised me is my sister's husband. She called me the next day at his recommendation, and we talked for a long time. She told me that she doesn't want to feel like ""a side character in the (my name) show,"" and that was how it was for all our childhoods. I told her that I feel like I'm not allowed to have meaningful relationships with any of our family, since she restricts what I say and do and wear around them. I pointed out that she controls my clothes for like every family event, and this is my wedding, and she admitted that was a good point. Eventually, she agreed to attend the wedding in a really cute black and white checkerboard dress and leave if it became too much.

The wedding itself was incredible. It was the second-best day of my life so far and my sister said she was genuinely happy for me. I felt like a princess in a fairytale the whole day, and my husband was the handsomest prince in the universe. The whole thing was under the stars, it was perfect. I could talk about it forever, but character limits. As a wedding gift, my sister told me that she was going to start letting me wear what I liked at family gatherings, and talk about my accomplishments, AND talk about myself when it's just me and her a little. And she has, and it's been great. The only better gift I got that night was my husband himself.

This past year has been the best of my life, and I genuinely feel so much better about life and family these days. I'm a girlmom now, and I'm so glad my daughter gets to know her aunt and cousins too. I'm even allowed to babysit for my sister sometimes!

TL;DR: Everything really worked out, and it was a lot because this place helped me have confidence that I wasn't wrong. Thank you guys so much, and have a great new year!

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I am glad your wedding turned out lovely and your relationship with your family has improved! Well done, your hard work being a better sister and daughter has started to pay off!

>**OOP:** Thank you so much! Yeah, it's been really incredible. My mom even came to see a musical I was in this year, which is the first time she's done that since I was sixteen!

Commenter: How did you come to realize and value relationships?

>**OOP:** I've always valued relationships. I want to have people in my life, and I do love my family. I just didn't understand that me getting attention took away from other people. I really, really love attention, but I figured that was just a me thing, since other people get stuff like stage fright, or nerves talking to strangers or crushes, and a lot of people are shy or don't want to be center of attention. It didn't occur to me that the stuff I did was bad.

Commenter: I hope you’re not discouraged by some of these comments. It sounds like you’re on the right track to repairing your family and should keep it up. Given that your husband is also a narcissist, you should both work with therapists to make sure your narcissism doesn’t negatively impact your child - there’s a pretty big risk there, to be frank, especially if you are spending so much effort moderating your behavior in other areas of life.

>**OOP:** Already under advisement. We're doing everything we can to stay aware of what kids of narcissists can experience so we can avoid it. We both love her so, so much, and we'd never hurt her for the world.

Commenter: What were you wearing that your sister had to be in charge of your outfits???

>**OOP:** I like really long, flowy dresses, sort of a cottagecore princess vibe, with a lot of accessories and sparkly jewelry and stuff like that. Flowers in my hair and that kind of thing. It does show off my body though, and my sister says that's attention seeking and caused her to have an unhealthy relationship with food for a long time.

Commenter: Where did you get that NPD diagnosis from, and have you ever gotten a second opinion? Because this whole situation smells funny.

>**OOP:** I was professionally diagnosed! My current therapist agrees with that diagnosis.  
*OOP reiterates:*  
I do have my own therapist, and I really truly am a narcissist. Genuinely. If you met me you would understand.  
*OOP explains:*  
Actually, my sister's therapist helped with a lot of the boundaries!

Commenter: You understand that a diagnosis can be reached in error, yeah? A desire to ""recover"" from NPD is almost perfectly diagnostic for not actually having it. ""Other people are not like me; they have desires and needs that are different than my own"" is something you wouldn't find it possible to understand if you're genuinely a narcissist.

>**OOP:** I don't think that's true. I mean first off, a hallmark of the disorder is thinking you are \*not\* like other people, not that everyone is like you. Either you think you're way better or way worse or both.

*You're handling this well:*

>Thank you, I'm trying my best. My husband really helps! It's like, so amazing to have someone who just gets it, you know? I can walk up to him, sit in his lap, and be like, ""I want to sing you a whole musical right now,"" and he'll sit and listen and applaud whatever I want, and if he walks up to me and is like ""I'm going to read you this essay about how everyone but me is stupid"" I will listen and be delighted and in full agreement because he IS the smartest person. It makes everything easier because we get to be ourselves around each other and it's the best thing ever, AND we're both completely obsessed with our baby because she is the best baby to ever live.

Commenter: Do you ever worry you will get upset with your child like you do your friends? Like you said a friend made you sit in the back and you started thinking she was awful and you hated her until you realized you were overreacting. Do you worry how you will treat your daughter when she is old enough to talk back or tell you she hates you (she won’t mean it, all teens say it). Will you be able to love her when she is her own person and not just a reflection of you?

>**OOP:** That's one of my deepest fears honestly. I've got plans in place for how I'm supposed to react to everything but realistically things don't go according to plan. I love her so much, and I never want to hurt her. But if I ever do, I'll spend every moment trying to make it right, and I'll let her know from the start that Mommy isn't always right about everything, and sometimes Mommy makes mistakes, but she's always loved no matter what.

It was this one!

*One last thought:*

>I'll never not be a narcissist, but I'm trying my best to be a good person.

**Editor's note:** There are hundreds of comments from OOP. Most of the comments on the update are people arguing about whether or not she's a narcissist and what boundaries she should/shouldn't have. It's very interesting to hear OOP's perspectives, but I've already included many of her comments so don't want to make it too long. However, I'll include two more that detail some more of her past:

**OOP:** Okay you want to hear why I am a diagnosed narcissist? Let's go.

1. If I don't get attention, am alone too long, or cannot express everything in my mind to someone-- doesn't really matter who-- I can't feel anything. I just go numb. There's no happiness, no anger, no anything, just this vat of numbness that is unbearably dull and cannot be escaped until I have all eyes on me.
2. I genuinely believe I am the best at everything I do on an emotional level. I think I am a musical genius, and there's a bit to back that up, but I also think I'm a dancer on the level of at least any backup at a concert, that my drawings are good enough to be in a museum, that my writing is deep and ingenius, that I'm prettier than 99% of models even with the baby weight, that I can act well enough to win an Oscar if I was ever randomly put in a big budget movie for no reason... and I have nothing backing any of THAT up, except maybe the writing being slightly above average. My husband has told me that he agrees with the model thing and I have to put that in this reply.
3. The last time I failed-- full on failed-- it was at chemistry, and I temporarily became a full on antivaxxer because I decided chemistry was made up and stupid and nobody could ever really understand it and they were all just getting lucky and also evil. In reality I am not good at science. I still kind of resent scientists. I also decided that my teacher must be madly in love with me and punishing me for being so beautiful because he didn't want his wife to divorce him. That is how my mind works when I am not good at a thing.
4. I recently sat my husband down, told him that I had rewritten a whole musical to be about another character, and how it was so much better than the original. I one-woman showed both the original and then mine in front of him without even my piano and demanded he tell me in detail all the ways mine was better than the original. He has never seen the original or read the book it was based on first.
5. I will talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. Look at this post. Look how many hours I've spent talking about myself. In detail that's probably not the smartest. Because I am absolutely loving the attention. I've had four hour conversations in which the other person said maybe ten sentences max. My husband wants to inform you that it is more like ten words.
6. My friend had me sit in the backseat instead of shotgun while she took me and two other girls to a very expensive concert for her birthday and I decided she must secretly hate me and that she was boring and mean anyway and by the time we reached the show I was sure I'd go no-contact after, only to realize the shotgun friend was the only one not sitting next to her in the show and she was trying to be fair and immediately remembering that actually she's really smart and kind and fun and I love her. I told her all this to her face the next day and she said she could tell because she saw me glaring at her in the rearview mirror.
7. I throw a ball on my birthday. A literal ball. We save up all year and I get a fancy dress and rent a ballroom. I make my friends call me ""Princess \[my name\] and pretend to be my ladies in waiting. The princess thing is actually pretty consistent in my life. I have tea parties at least once a month too.

I am not a poor little meow meow with a misdiagnosis. I'm a person who has more than one personality trait, and honestly I don't like that so many people want to say it's wrong, because my husband has the same diagnosis and so do a lot of my close friends, and they're the people I am able to be myself around best, and who most understand me. It hurts to hear them disparaged even if you're trying to uplift me in the process.

*How the husband relationship works:*

>Well, my husband and I just each see the other as an extension of ourselves, and we love each other. I have a princess complex, he has a hero complex, we require the other to fulfill that. For our friends, there's definitely some competition there, but there's also a lot of mutual enjoyment. One of my friends is a pretty famous influencer, and she's great to have around, because she gets us VIP treatment everywhere. She took the pictures for my wedding! We do fashion together, and I get a steady stream of promotion gifts from her because we have very different coloring and what looks good on me almost always looks not as good on her. And vice versa, I suppose. Another of my NPD friends is an alto and I'm a soprano, and so we're usually going for different roles in musicals. Basically, as long as we each have a defined niche, we can agree our group in total is the best and each of us is the best at our role. I'm the best blonde soprano musician in the group and I don't mind if other people are the best at their own thing, because I don't do social media/sing alto/whatever else.",1hzfadq,n/a,2025-01-12 05:00:24
CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,"Making a child eat everything on their plate will in one way or another damage someone's view on food.   

I have seen this outcome often and it's usually expressed in a few ways:

1. People don't stop eating when they are full. I don't want to offend anyone but a lot of the people I know who struggle with their weight been brought up in homes where they weren't allowed to leave the table until they had cleaned their plates. 
2. Meal time becomes a chore or downright unpleasant. When I went to stay with my father and his partner she would make me eat everything on my plate, I didn't portion the food out myself and it was often food that she wouldn't eat and that I hated. Meal time became me taking an hour to eat something because I was gagging between bites. I know people who are very picky eaters because they were forced as children to eat food that made them feel sick.
3. People who have small appetites will portions out less for themselves because being hungry is better than feeling sick.  
4. It creates fear of going without ""if you don't finish you won't get anything else"" can sound like ""I'm going to punish you for not finishing by leave you out""  
5. It makes someone a picky eater, you're going to stick to what you like if you're going to be made to eat all of it. 
6. Food becomes a reward ""if you eat everything you'll get dessert"" this creates two problems, for some people it's ""I've been good I can have this"" and for some people it's ""I haven't been good enough so I can't have this"" 
7. It can cause a dislike for certain foods, sometimes to the point of a phobia. In the same household I was often fed soggy, fatty bacon that was cooked in a microwave, if I even smell bacon cooking it makes me feel sick and this is more than a decade later. I have encountered this with many people I know who can't stand different dishes or ingredients.

Instead a child should be encouraged to try everything more than once without the pressure to eat all of it and if they genuinely don't like it then that's ok, also if a child doesn't manage to finish then they can eat it another day.

J.R.'s unhealthy relationship with food and his physique,"I just finished S3E4 and the way J.R. talks about fitness seems like a red flag. Did anyone else notice this? The two things that screamed out to me were the fact that he wants to bring a scale to their restaurant dates, and an ice breaker question he asked Sandy is ""what is your ideal celebrity body type."" 

I see some patterns with disordered eating behaviors and thats very worrisome. Not being able to enjoy food without a scale isn't a healthy way to live. Additionally, the thought process of coveting another persons body is worrisome. Sandy is very slim and fit so asking her who she would want to look like seems insulting. He mentioned he wants to look like Chris Hemsworth, and I wonder if he won't ever stop comparing himself to someone else. 

I worry that this can be triggering for people who are struggling with eating disorders and body dysmorphia. I also hope that if he has this struggle himself he can get the help he needs, hopefully before pushing these views on someone else. What do you think? ",1i8irxo,n/a,2025-01-24 00:35:53
Baristas Have A Weird Relationship With Food,"So every single cafe I have ever worked at has had one thing in common.

Break times roll around and you tell your fellow barista it's time for their break. You ask what they're having for lunch and they say ""Ah nothing. I don't really eat."" You ask if they had a big breakfast. ""Nah I don't eat breakfast."" Oh they're planning something for dinner? ""Nope.""

First place I worked at has multiple baristas just work ten hour shifts with nothing.

Second place I worked at has two guys who insisted they didn't need a proper lunch. One of them I knew didn't have breakfast, I *never ever* saw him drink a sip of water (I worked with him for forty+ hours a week for years) and he would have the tiniest bowl of cereal for lunch.

Third place has again had multiple people who just smoke?? They insist that they don't need a proper break. Just several smoke breaks.

Tbh I find this pretty bonkers. Why does this seem to be such a common thing with baristas??",180d8pd,n/a,2023-11-21 09:34:21
Breakthrough: It wasn’t the rice. It was my relationship with food,"For months I blamed rice. I tried cutting it, swapping it, hating it. But I’d always binge after a week, then feel awful Then one day I ate rice just one cup, slowly, with veggies and grilled tilapia and I felt full. Satisfied, not guilty. That was the moment it clicked: the problem wasn’t the rice. It was how I used food to reward, punish, distract, escape.

Since then, I’ve lost 6kg and I haven’t cut out anything, just started listening more.

I shared this in WeightLossPhilippines and it turns out… a lot of us are going through the same quiet realizations. You don’t have to do it alone.",1kcylzh,n/a,2025-05-02 11:29:18
“I think you need to try intuitive eating and fix your relationship with food cause you’re still weird around it”,"Look, I get my friend is trying to be nice and all, but I put on weight RAPIDLY when I’m not being mindful about what I eat and don’t exercise. She keeps encouraging me to treat myself with fast food/desserts when I don’t even crave them anymore, and I have a LEGIT PREDISPOSITION FOR BEING OBESE! My entire family was highly addicted to fast food and highly processed foods, and they developed TERRIBLE health consequences because of it. She also encourages me to drink alcohol, but I HATE drinking for multiple reasons and feel really anxious when I’m drinking (I’ll admit I’m down to smoke, but even then I RARELY do it because of all my families health complications). She’s like “I get it, but you don’t want to be the one person not drinking/eating the food” and it pisses me off because she KNOWS that I can’t just moderate it. I can’t just have ONE slice of pizza, I have to have the whole thing plus a slice of cake with ice cream and cookies, and while it can be linked to emotions, it’s also because I’m quite literally addicted. Even as a child when I came home from school, I would binge on highly processed foods and wouldn’t exercise. I’ve found that abstinence has made my life better, and even with weight maintenance/bulking, I gravitate to Whole Foods because it just makes me feel better. Idk, I just wanted to rant on here because frankly the idea of binge drinking + eating highly processed foods doesn’t sound like my idea of a good time- what does is going boating, having the energy to enjoy the outdoors, rollerblading, painting in the park, ect. And while you can definitely bring food into it, why does it have to be highly processed stuff that makes you feel like shit?!",14t9047,n/a,2023-07-07 14:33:38

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/i_caught_my_twin_doing_something_but_she_says_its/)**: September 27, 2024**

Okay so I’m 15 and a female, but the one with symptoms is my twin sister who is also 15. We are fraternal if that makes a difference. She’s 5’5.5 and she was 135 pounds at the start of cross country season when we got our physicals but she’s visibly smaller now and I don’t know what she weighs anymore. For medical history, she gets migraines and has medicine for that.

So we are twins and we look super similar, it’s obvious we are twins, but I’ve always been shorter and skinnier. I was a lot smaller than her at birth and basically never caught up lmao. But that’s the only real difference physically. She always liked being the taller one because she’s 3 minutes older too. When we got our physicals in July though, she got super upset that I weighed 113 pounds and she was 135. She’s also two and a half inches taller than me though and the doctor said our weights were totally perfect. The doctor could tell she was upset and told her not to worry about her weight because she looks beautiful and she’s healthy, and she said she wasn’t worried but I could tell she was lying. And honestly the night before we had eaten at this Greek restaurant with massive portions and it was probably poop weight. Not to be gross. But yeah.

A couple days later she asked our mom to buy grapefruit. Our mom is well meaning and overall a really good mom but she did modeling when she was younger and she’s a complete almond mom. Like she’s always on a diet and talking about how fat she is when she’s not. So she was super happy that Isabel wanted to eat healthier. Isabel explained this whole diet plan of only eating good foods and being super healthy. It sounded stupid to me but I wanted to be supportive. She said she wanted to get to 125. Which her weight before was fine but that was still pretty reasonable so I tried to be supportive.

She went unhinged. She started watching nutrition influencers on TikTok and insta. So she started off eating this diet of grapefruit and coffee for breakfast, a salad and half a cup of dry cheerios at lunch, and grilled chicken breast with honey mustard and grapes for dinner. After like two weeks of this I found her in our closet eating an entire sleeve of Oreos and a plate of nachos and a tortilla covered in melted chocolate chips, and she was sobbing. I told her she wasn’t eating enough and that’s why her brain made her do that. I helped her clean up and we went for a walk and I thought she was done with the diet, but then she was searching “how to prevent binges” which lead her to following this instagram model named Caroline Deisler, or something like that. Anyway she’s a vegan and then my sister decided this is her goal body and she’s going to be vegan too. My mom was super supportive of this. Over the last two months the amount she’s eating keeps getting less and less. Now she’s living off almost exclusively fruit and honey roasted almonds and coconut yogurt, with the occasional lemon juice and olive oil salad. She told my mom she doesn’t want “bad” food in the house. This sucks for me because I don’t want to live off of rabbit food, but also I’m really worried about my sister.

Shes doing some really weird stuff with her food. She chews everything so long it must be paste, she uses tiny plates for everything and refuses to eat off red or yellow plates, and she spends ages arranging her food in patterns. She won’t eat if she can’t drink water with it. She also barely goes to stuff with our friends and me anymore and she says it’s because she’s tired or has homework but she mostly avoids things that involve eating so I feel like that’s probably what she’s actually doing. Her times at cross country keep getting worse instead of better and she looks miserable when we’re running and she’s so angry lately, and I’m pretty sure it’s because she’s hungry. I keep telling my mom I think something isn’t right and she tells me jealousy is an ugly look.

So this all leads us to last Friday. We were at a football game with friends, and I forgot to charge my phone. I wanted to show one of our friends the dress I was wearing for homecoming because she wasn’t in the group chat, so I took my sisters phone. I opened her pictures to find the dress and there were pictures of her that she took in her underwear but they didn’t look like nudes, it was like she was trying to see how bony she was. And she looks awful. But I knew she would be embarrassed if our friend saw this and so I closed out of photos and opened safari to just Google the store I bought the dress at and it opened to this forum about eating disorders. I pretended I didn’t see it, I looked up the dress, and then I gave my sister her phone and tried not to act weird all night. So then in bed later I looked the site up.

It’s awful. It’s seriously awful. It’s people talking about losing weight and having competitions and posting their skinny bodies and wanting to be unhealthy. They share tips on not eating and eating less and not getting caught. I don’t know what my sisters username was, I didn’t have time to see so I couldn’t find her profile, but no one on the site was healthy. I was crying reading it because it’s freaking awful.

So the next day when we were walking home from the gas station I offered her some of my bar, and she said no. I asked again and she said no, she just wanted her Celsius. And I told her I thought she needed to eat something. She flipped out at me and told me to stop being pushy and weird and I told her I found the website. At first she said she was researching for a school project and I was like “Izzy what project we have all the same classes”. She got super pissed at me and she’s barely been talking to me all week and said if I tell anyone she’ll never talk to me again.

I looked up eating disorders. I’m not trying to make this about me but it says they can be really bad for you and make you infertile. It looks like a big deal. And not eating can kill you right? People die of that. I’ve been an absolute mess for the last week thinking about this. She’s ignoring me acting like everything is fine and eating almost nothing.

I’m sorry this got so long. I just don’t know what to do…she told me to let it go because she’s fine and just being healthier and she’ll increase her food when cross country season is done because she can’t run if she’s full. But that sounds…stupid. She told me everyone diets, our mom has literally always been in a diet, pretty much everyone in our friend group has been on a diet or tried to lose weight and I’m overreacting. This is the only place I knew I could ask doctors about this without having to tell them who I am.

Could this make my sister sick or even kill her? Is it my fault because I’m smaller and she felt bad? How can I help her? She’s so angry and so mean lately and I’m really scared for her. I don’t want her to get hurt but I also don’t want her to hate me.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: if your mother won't help with this I'd get another trusted family member to help as well. This can be dangerous and sounds like an ED. You're a great sister for worrying about her and seeking help.

>**OOP:** Is it dangerous enough to call our dad over? He’s like a Christmas/birthday dad

Commenter: \[...\] You said your dad is a Christmas dad so I don't know how he can help being so far away but I'd consider reaching out to dad if your mom is unreasonable or minimizes what's happening.

>**OOP:** That’s the worst part he’s not far away- we just only see him on our birthday and Christmas lmao. He lives like 2 miles away. I’ll try to find a time to talk to my mom when my sister isn’t around. The times I’ve brought it up when she’s around in the past they both accuse me of being dramatic and jealous. Plus my sister threatened to tell our mom I’ve vaped a couple times if I brought it up again 😬

Commenter: You need to find another adult that's dependable. It doesn't sounding your dad is that present in your life

It doesn't sound like your mom cares enough or is too ignorant or just wants to cover her eyes and pretend everything is OK

>**OOP:** My parents are super young and kind of immature. They’re both 33 and 32 so I try not to be too hard on them…like at least they didn’t delete us I guess? But also I kind of think maybe my mom has problems too and actually thinks it’s normal? I’ve just been really anxious trying to figure this out and I’m afraid something bad will happen to my sister if she keeps doing this

Commenter: I don't blame you at all but they need to fucking grow the fuck up and be parents. You say you're 15.... so your parents had you at 18 and 17 respectively and I am assuming they are divorced or never married since they don't live together and your deadbeat \[and I'm being kind here\] dad isn't around enough to notice the problem or care. \[...\]

>**OOP:** They’re not really bad or abusive but I think my mom almost sees us more like we’re all the same age than that she’s our mom? But yeah I really wish she’d be more of an adult at least for this

Commenter: Do you have any other adults in your life that you trust that could help? An aunt or uncle, grandparents or teacher?

>**OOP:** We don’t talk to my mom’s side of the family since we were like 5. My dad’s parents we know but not super well. But they’re not bad or anything so I think they might help. My sister seems like she really likes our math teacher. Would it be weird if told her?

Commenter: I feel this. I'm a twin too, we are identical. My sister has had a lot of ups and downs with her mental health and it's the worst feeling to be there seeing it and not be able to fix it. Wondering why is she hurting so much when I am (comparatively) ok? Thinking that if I just tried harder I could somehow save her from this. It's not fair, but know that you can't fix this for her, you can just be there supporting her as she goes through treatment.

>**OOP:** Yes that’s exactly it. Like I feel so guilty that she’s having this issue and I’m not… and then I wonder if it’s genetic and I’ll end up like that too? I don’t want to. And usually she’s always been honest with me and we don’t have secrets but she’s pulling away and saying we need space and our own lives now…

**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpaeq83/:)**: 2.5 hours later**

**OOP:** Tonight she’s been using this stepper thing to step up and down while we are watching a show and I didn’t say anything because I don’t want to make her suspicious or more mad, but then she kind of tripped on it and sat down and put her head in her lap and said she was going to throw up. I had her lay down and got her some water and a bucket but she’s all sweaty and said she doesn’t feel good and thinks she has a stomach thing…but could this be from her not eating? Is there a different way to help if she’s sick than if it’s because of the eating stuff? I was rubbing her back and it’s all bumpy and boney and I’m really freaked out

*Blood sugar:*

Our mom is asleep. I had to argue with her to get her to suck on a jolly rancher. Hopefully it helps the blood sugar thing if that’s it

**Another Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpd3dk7/:)**: September 28, 2024 (5 hours later)**

**OOP:** This morning she thanked me for helping her last night and told me she knows she’s being stupid and said she’d stop and begged me not to say anything. She promised she’d eat more and stop being weird about stuff. I don’t know if I should give her the chance or tell anyway…if I give her a chance and she doesn’t go through with it could something bad happen in that time?

**OOP:** I sent our cross country coach a text and asked if we can go get smoothies or something later. Hopefully she doesn’t think that’s weird. I just don’t want to talk where my sister might hear. She said she was going to do better and then she ate carrots for lunch

**OOP:** Earlier this afternoon my sister fainted like a half hour after she took a shower and she wasn’t answering or waking up and so I freaked out and called an ambulance and she woke up by the time they got there but she couldn’t see anything at first and she hit her head. So now she’s mad at me and won’t let me see her and my moms mad because she said we could’ve just made a doctor appointment if I told her instead of going over her head and making a scene but I knew this was bad. And I know it’s horrible but I hope they don’t let her leave the hospital until she’s better. Thanks for answering my questions. I probably would’ve been too scared to call 911 otherwise. I knew she wasn’t okay.

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: You absolutely, unequivocally, did the right thing.  

If you are able to, I think it might be a good idea to reach out to the team that is seeing your sister and disclose this information. If you are worried about your relationship with her, you can ask them to please not tell her that you said this. She may very well try to hide her recent weight loss and her eating habits from her doctors, and it is incredibly important that they know about this. They may already suspect it or know it based on her presentation, but having your collateral information will be very helpful

>**OOP:** The doctors at the hospital you mean? The paramedics asked me what happened and I told them I think she’s not eating on purpose and she’s lost a lot of weight. Would they know because of that or would I have to tell them again? Also the paramedics said her pulse was low, and her blood pressure. I don’t remember the blood pressure numbers but her pulse was 41. Is that why she fainted?

Commenter: Her heart rate is likely due to nutrition issues and low electrolytes. Either way I'm glad you called the ambulance and took her to the hospital

You're handing this as well as you can and saved her life.

Where are your parents in this? Surely they must know now.

>**OOP:** My mom knows. She’s here too. I called my dad and he was mad no one told him sooner

Commenter: Nothing to apologize for. This isn’t your fault and you’re the only person in her life who recognizes this for the emergency that it is. Your mom and friends are gaslighting you and only enabling her restrictive eating and delaying her from getting help.

I’m a critical care physician.  
Every once in a while someone like your sister comes to the ICU with life threatening complications from starvation. Everything you just described is very alarming. Can’t say medically if she has caused any significant or permanent damage to her body. She will reach that point If this continues. I think she needs help far beyond what friends, family and even her pediatrician can provide.this is they type of thing that requires everything from social workers, psychiatry, psychotherapy and an experienced pediatrician to really get her what she needs.

Is there is anyone in her life besides your mom who uou can confide in? Could be a coach, a trusted teacher, guidance counselor, religious leader. I know you don’t want to go against your sister, but she isn’t in a state where she can make rational decisions for herself. She needs your help.

>**OOP:** Thank you for this. It was a really long night just waiting. But she got admitted and finally said I could come be with her. I told the doctor everything I knew. She won’t eat anything. I called my dad and he and my mom are fighting about how she got this way. She said she doesn’t want everyone to be mad but she can’t eat

**OOP:** She got admitted here. There’s a lot of blood labs and they’re been trying to convince her to eat but she either doesn’t or she takes it and then flushes it down the toilet. I’ve been trying to tell them everything I can think of that might matter. I don’t understand why she’s doing this and I’m starting to feel kind of mad which I know it’s not her fault but it’s so hard to watch

Commenter: I'm so sorry... she needs so much help. She's in the hospital and still refuses to nourish herself.

Has she seen psychiatry yet?

Are your parents actually starting to comprehend how serious this is? Or do they need another verbal splash of cold water?

>**OOP:** My dad does. My mom just keeps pleading with her and suggesting giving her salads because it would be easier. The doctor said she’s going to get a tube in her nose if she won’t start eating. I’m not sure if she’s seen psychiatry, she’s seen a few people that I had to leave the room for

**Title:** What does an NG tube feel like? How long does it stay?

Hi. I’m 15 and female, so is my twin sister who this is about. She wasn’t eating and lost a lot of weight. She’s 5’5.5 and about 105 pounds. She lost 30 pounds in 2 months. Now she’s in the hospital because she fainted but it’s been a couple days and she refuses to eat and keeps trying to pinch her IV and the doctor said she’s getting an NG tube. I had questions about everything but I didn’t want to ask them in front of her and scare her or have her doctor think I was being nosy or rude, so I wanted to ask here since last time everyone was helpful.

What does an NG tube feel like?

How long does it stay in?

Will she be able to mess with it?

Why is she just completely refusing everything now? Why doesn’t she just eat?

When I was researching anorexia, which is what the doctor said she has, I saw it’s genetic. Does that mean I could end up like her too?

How long do you stay in the hospital for anorexia? I miss her being home with me.

***Top Comment:***

**DrSocialDeterminants:** It can stay for quite a while. I've seen people leave it for days. That said, she can yank it out at great pain to herself.

I also remember your story as I was one of the docs that posted a response. I'm sorry to see she's still struggling. It's clear from your posts and updates that my concerns were correct and that she's very sick

I would estimate she needs weeks to recover physically from how malnourished she is to get her stable enough to not collapse walking out of the hospital. However, I'm truly concerned that she's a suicide risk to herself as she's shown that even in the hospital, her refusal to eat would be dangerous. I suspect that she will likely be transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility to get more intensive therapy and potentially medications to address her other mental health concerns.

She's in it for the long haul. That said, even after discharge she will likely need years or therapy and support. She will always have a lingering struggle with food and body dysmorphia. She has a great sister to help support her though and that will be helpful in her recovery.

I don't know the evidence for the genetic risks of eating disorders. We know that sometimes family history is important for things like depression and anxiety but thisnisnt my specialty. More importantly, it doesn't mean you're doomed to have this. I would instead focus my efforts on the environment.... thinking of how to have a healthy relationship with food and your body.

I remember your earlier post about her getting upset that you weighed less. She was also getting her mom to support her dieting. You also said you mom constantly says that she's overweight herself and diets despite not needing to. The first thing for your sister is to work through why she's competing with you regarding weight. Honestly though... if your mom constantly says things like she has, then frankly she needs to stop as that's so unhealthy to say that it definitely can contribute to body shaming and displeasure at your body image.

Hi…This is my third post. I’m really sorry. I’m just so scared and I don’t know who else to ask because hospital doctors won’t tell me much.

My twin sister is 15 and female. She went on this insane diet that turned into anorexia and she lost 30 pounds in two months. Then she fainted and got admitted to the hospital. She wouldn’t eat there either so they put a tube in her. She wouldn’t drink anything but she gets fluids in an IV. So now she’s just refusing to sleep. Because they can’t put that in a tube I guess. But all she does is cry and ask me the same questions over and over like if I’m mad at her and if I love her.

She had a seizure a few days back which was really scary. I don’t understand why she’s doing this and I’m really scared that she’s not sleeping on purpose. What happens if you don’t sleep?? Will you get sick? Can her doctors make her sleep? I don’t understand why she keeps refusing to do basic things. She can’t go to treatment until she’s stable and she says she wants to leave the hospital but it’s like she’s trying to die

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Hi. Dont be sorry about your questions, ask as many as you like!

When someone doesn’t sleep for a while, it can mess with them... like making them feel confused or really sad or make it harder for the body to fight off bad things.

The doctors know what is best for her, and i promise that she is very good hands.  
They might have ways to get her to sleep, even if it means giving her some meds for a bit. They’re watching her closely, trust me - especially since she had a seizure.

I know you’re scared and it’s totally okay and totally normal to feel that way. stay close to your sister, even if she seems distant, that can mean a lot for both of u. and dont forget yourself. if you can, talk to some adult you trust, maybe some of the doctors/nurses?

All the best to both of you.

>**OOP:** I think it is making her feel really sad. She cries almost constantly. She keeps biting her lip to keep herself awake I guess, but it’s swollen and bloody. And when I ask her why she’s doing this and tell her it’s okay to sleep because I’m here too she just says she can’t

Commenter: I just want to chime in here and say that your sister is not doing this to herself, she has a serious illness that results in behavioural changes. Your sister's brain registers food as a threat and she is responding to it in this way. I have seen people with eating disorders force themselves to stay awake because it may burn ever so slightly more calories, or in hospital, are afraid that if they fall asleep, someone may increase feeds/add something to them/push a bolus through, etc.

Some people find it helpful to conceptualise the anorexia as separate to their loved one- or view anorexia as a ""terrorist"" who has taken their loved one hostage. Take care of yourself, and if you have capacity, spend time with your sister so you both remember who she is without the illness.

>**OOP:** I’ve been playing cards with her, and brought our switches, and we are still doing our book club that we’ve done since we were in second grade. I pretty much try not to talk about it unless she brings it up because I don’t want her to feel like I forgot her.

Commenter: You are doing all the right things! Keep on being you, and don’t forget to rest and recuperate yourself - this experience will be just as traumatising for you so be kind to yourself.

I wonder if reiterating to her that you will protect her while she’s asleep, that you won’t let anyone touch her. Maybe holding her will help soothe her enough?

>**OOP:** She just keeps saying she’s too cold to sleep and she wants to go home

**Title:** How much medicine do you give patients in the hospital? Is my sister lying?

My sister is in the hospital for anorexia. She’s 15. She lost a lot of weight and she got a tube in her nose because she wouldn’t eat. It feels like everything has gotten worse since we came here, like being in the hospital made her sicker, and it’s my fault she’s here because I’m the one who called an ambulance on her. But I think I caught her lying about stuff again…

In her bag she has a ton of pills all in one of the pockets. I found them looking for her chapstick. I asked her about it and first she said it was Tylenol but I told her it doesn’t look like it and there’s more than one kind. Then she said they are just her prescription but she dropped the bottle and it broke so she put them in the pocket. But here’s the thing…it’s different kinds. There’s only one kind in a prescription right? So she’s lying? She’s just not taking anything they give her and she’s putting it in her bag? I thought in the hospital they only give you your medicine for the day, not the whole prescription.

I don’t want to tell on her if she’s telling the truth and make her more mad at me and not trust me but it feels like she’s lying. I know some of the medicine is for sleeping and some is for depression. I don’t know about the other one. If she’s not taking it could it hurt her? Is it worth telling them about?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: She might be stashing the ones the hospital gives her. You need to tell her care team about this. Stashing pills is a warning sign.

>**OOP:** A warning sign for what? It feels like she doesn’t want to get better. It’s like she’s sabotaging everything

Commenter: *it feels like she doesn’t want to get better* yes, that’s what mental illness does. She’s in the right place with people who can medically take care of her, you did the right thing bringing her in.

Stashing pills can mean she might be planning to take them all at once to unalive herself. Please tell her care team.

>**OOP:** Fuck. Okay. Thank you. Fuck this sucks.  
*(later to the same commenter):*  
Sorry I shouldn’t have swore that much it’s rude and it wasn’t at you

*How OOP feels:*

It’s so stupid and if I think about it I feel angry so I just don’t so I can’t feel anything. I hate this. I don’t know why she’s doing this when she was fine a few months ago.

*Treatment center:*

She’s not even in a treatment place yet. They won’t take her because she isn’t stable. She’s in a normal hospital

*She needs to be kept under constant observation:*

A nurse was watching her because she kept messing with her tube, but she stopped doing that I think so they weren’t with her all the time the last couple days. But I told the nurse anyway about the medicine and she said she’d take care of it. It feels like the hospital is making her worse

**Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g22key/comment/lrq3c3u/)**: October 13, 2024 (Next Day)**

The doctor came and asked about the pills. She had prescription water pills that weren’t hers, the sleeping medicine they’ve been giving her and thinking she’s been taking, and a stimulant. She won’t say where she got the prescription ones that weren’t hers.

The doctor told her they check all patients bags periodically if they come for mental health so thankfully she doesn’t know it was me that told on her. I asked why she’s doing this and she said she doesn’t know and keeps apologizing.

I keep switching between being mad and being heartbroken. It’s hard to figure out how to feel when it seems like she’s doing it herself. I know she’s not. But there’s nothing tangible like a tumor or bad blood lab to blame and it’s hard to wrap my head around. Sometimes I don’t want to be here with her.

She told me she’s afraid they’re going to make her overweight and I’ll always be the prettier one and I don’t know how to respond to that stuff so I told her I’d like her no matter what and maybe I can eat a bunch of cake so I can be bigger and she can push me around in a scooter. I just miss her. My parents won’t talk about it other than blaming each other. My friends just want all the juicy details.

I’m sorry for rambling so much…it’s just that there isn’t anywhere else anyone actually listens. I know she’s the one that’s sick and not me but it’s really hard.

*Comments:*

Commenter: I wanna give you a hug, you’re a sweetie and you deserve just as much care as you give others

>**OOP**: I would totally take it. I don’t think anyone has hugged me since she got admitted. It’s like I’m invisible now

Commenter: It can help to create some distance by remembering that it's the eating disorder that gets mad and doesn't want to get better. Behind that wall your sister is just sad, scared and sick. \[...\]

>**OOP:** I’ve been trying to think of it like that. Or like she’s possessed. We’re Catholic lmao. But I just want her to be okay.

*Getting therapy:*

>My mom accused me of making it all about myself and my dad asked if I was going to starve myself too and if he should buy a second headstone when I asked about therapy but I found an online ai thingy that’s a little helpful

Commenter: Frankly your mom's been in denial the whole time, which is ironic since she's probably a reason that contributed to your sister since you said your mom is superficial about body image.

Your dad is out of line and what a rude thing to say.

>**OOP:** I think he just can’t handle both of us being needy at the same time. He doesn’t really get why she’s doing this either

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1g5czoo/if_my_twin_sister_has_anorexia_could_i_get_it_too/) **5: October 16, 2024 (3 days later, 3 weeks from OG post)**

I’m a 15 year old female. So is my twin sister, of course. She is really sick with anorexia. It started at the end of the summer and went downhill fast, she lost 30 pounds, and she’s in the hospital with a tube in her nose fighting every attempt to help her. It’s like she’s two people. And i don’t understand at all but she said she doesn’t know why she’s doing it either.

I’ve been researching anorexia to try and understand and see how I can help her and I keep seeing article mentioning how there’s a genetic component. At first I kept thinking “that could never happen to me” but my sister thought the same thing and I don’t think anyone tries to be anorexic… I skipped meals a couple days and then tried fasting for a few to see if I could understand why she’s doing this and I guess i sort of felt proud that I was able to stick with the diet but it didn’t feel so good I would want to slowly kill myself in front of everyone I love over it….is there a chance this could happen to me too? As in am I at a higher risk of also ending up like her because of the genetic part? If so, is there anything I can do to prevent it? Watching her is so scary. It’s not even her anymore. She’s been swallowed up by the anorexia.

As a side note also…is there anything I can do to help her?

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gokcju/can_you_accidentally_make_yourself_anorexic/) **6: November 10, 2024**

**Title:** Can you accidentally make yourself anorexic?

I’m 15, female, 5’3 and 104 pounds.

A bit over a month ago my twin sister got diagnosed with anorexia. She’s in a hospital now and getting better. I was really afraid when she got diagnosed that I would end up like that because I read it was genetic. I didn’t understand at all, I’ve never cared about my body and I still don’t…but I feel like I’ve been fixating on not becoming anorexic so much that I’m actually creating a problem. I went from 113 to 104 in the last month.

I keep getting scared that I’m not eating enough so then I go and eat a lot, like panic eating to try and not under eat and I est so much that I feel sick and embarrassed and gross and at first I was trying to run it off but then I realized I could just throw it up….and I started doing that. I know it’s not good, obviously. And it’s super gross.

But does this mean I’m accidentally making myself anorexic because of how hard I’m trying to avoid it? I don’t care about my weight…I’m not trying to lose weight but I keep losing it anyway. I’m just stuck in this cycle where I feel scared that I’m not eating enough and I suddenly need to set everything but then after I feel so horrible and I want it gone. My mom keeps seeing that I’m eating a ton and telling me I don’t have to eat for me and my sister and that I’m going to get diabetes…I feel like this isn’t good but I don’t know who to ask about this because it’s going to sound so stupid when my sister was literally almost dead from starving herself to ask if I have an issue.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Hey OP! I remember you and your posts. I’m so sorry you are struggling. There are a lot of ways that we can have a difficult relationship with food, and you have been through an ENORMOUS amount of stress in the last few months. What you are doing, as you guessed, is not healthy and can become an eating disorder on its own if you don’t get help. But the earlier you get help, the better the outcome. Can you ask your mom to get your own therapist ? If she’s not open to it, could you talk to a social worker at school or maybe at the hospital where your sister is?

>**OOP:** Hi. I remember you too. I feel kind of stupid asking to see a therapist because I don’t want anyone to think I’m copying her or that I want attention :/ I’m really not, but it’s like it I can’t stop thinking about it and I forgot how I used to eat without thinking. But the place my sister is at had a sibling support group that I go to, maybe the therapist who leads it could help?

Commenter: I just saw the sentence about the sibling support group, sorry! Yes, absolutely! Go talk to the therapist! I’m sure that you will not be the first sibling needing more help. I really think this is the best thing you can do.

>**OOP:** I’m going to ask tonight if she can recommend anyone I could see and if she’d help me tell my parents

*How sis is doing:*

Thank you. My sister is doing a lot better. She’s a lot less angry, and she talks about different stuff now. I feel like I completely forgot how I used to eat without thinking before and I forget to eat and then panic that I’m not eating enough and then overeat and then want it gone. I haven’t been feeling hungry at all. I’m hoping you’re right that when it’s further away it’ll be easier. I’m afraid I’m going to make things worse for my sister too if I start doing this. She already told me I look skinnier last time I visited :/

**Editor's note:** OOP comment on this post on November 22, 2024

Hi. So this is about me. I just wanted to say my sister is okay. She’s not worse anyway. She still doesn’t really want to get better though because she doesn’t think anything is wrong. But physically she’s getting better I think. She looks better to me. Also I’m okay. I figured out how to stop throwing up. I made myself a meal plan and if I follow it I don’t feel super chaotic and anxious and I don’t end up doing that stuff.

"Anyone else working on having a healthier relationship with food, not just a “better” diet?","  
Lately, I’ve realized that knowing *what* to eat isn’t the hard part — it’s *how* I think about food that really needed work.

For years I bounced between strict tracking and total chaos. Now I’m trying to eat more mindfully, listen to my body, and stop labeling food as “good” or “bad.” It’s surprisingly difficult to unlearn that black-and-white thinking.

Has anyone else been on this kind of journey? What helped you shift from just chasing macros or weight loss goals to actually building a more balanced mindset around food?",1l4yiuk,n/a,2025-06-06 17:39:15
[Mcu] thanos obsessively insists famine is the cause of all misery because of his species' relationship with food.,"If thanos cut all living populations in half, humanity would repopulate in under 200 years, assuming of course our planet didn't suffer a massive ecological collapse due to the extinction of eusocial organisms like bees that depend on their numbers.  Yet thanos adamantly thinks culling a population like a herd of deer will solve all their problems.  

Interestingly, our own species outlived stronger and more intimidating relatives like neanderthals with their bruce lee esque strength, denisovans with their big robust skeletons and barrel chests, and god knows what else that didn't make it into the fossil record.  (We even have fossils of some genetic mutant race split from our own species, called boskop men, who apparently had bigger, smarter brains, and a short run of survival in south-central africa)

As far as we know, we survived by adopting some kind of weird almost-r-strategist survival tactic.  

Our bodies are disproportinately weak and cheap to grow for a species our size, we can subsist on nearly anything, we quickly metabolize fat, and our incredibly slow growing young force us to band together en masse, unlike the neanderthals who reached maturity at 15.

Ancient pre neolithic structures like gobekli tepe even suggest that we had absolutely obscene and competent populations long before the time we believe the agricultural revolution to have occurred in.

I suggest thanos's species evolved for the **exact opposite** niche.  Extreme k strategy, impossible feats of individual strength and survivability, and as a result, a titan population needs an unimaginable amount of calories to survive.

While humans define the progression of hamlet to village to town to city by the logistic concerns that naturally arise from growing population, the titans were able to flourish with small numbers alone, and erect structures with far less need for factory machinery and tools.  Their strength cut countless steps of production in nearly every area. They never adapted to see the social threats to survival that could be provided by fellow sapient creatures because they didn't survive their first major population boom.",geew7n,n/a,2020-05-06 06:42:04

Worry about this sub’s relationship with food and advice on caloric intake,"I have been seeing all kinds of crazy advice on here about dropping caloric intake to 900-1000 per day. 

This is madness. 

The human female body needs at a minimum 1200 cal/day and the human male 1500 cal/day. These are MINIMUMS. If you aren’t eating enough calories you will experience adaptive thermogenesis - and that will impair all kinds of bodily function.

Food fuels our bodies. We need it. Starving yourself to try and speed up weight loss on any drug or diet or plan is unhealthy and unsustainable.

My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't know how to approach it.,"My gf (F29) and I (M29) have been together for about 7 years. She was never really an especially slim girl but over the years she's gradually gotten further and further away from that.

Now, as much as I hate to admit it or put it in such a blunt way, I think she's now overweight.

There's a few trends I've noticed in the way she approaches food and general health and they're concerning because she reinforces and defends them instead of taking advice into consideration.

She eats her feelings. This is exactly as it sounds but she's a very emotional person and most variances from the norm lead to eating some type of snack. Tonight she was upset about something from work and tried for about half an hour to convince me to take her to McDonald's for a sundae and has gotten upset with me in the past for saying no.

This leads into the next issue. She pulls me into her binges. She doesn't like going out for snacks like these without me. I think she feels like my approval absolves her of responsibility for her decision. Unfortunately if I say no, she gets upset with me and she tends to not let it go unless I either cave in or leave. She does the same thing with snacks she makes at home because she'll make 2 and give me 1 without asking if I'm interested. She'll then get mad at me for ""wasting food"" if I don't partake.

This is problematic for my fitness as I'm a first responder and I can't afford to pack on the pounds. With covid it's even harder to work them off. More importantly though, that's not what I want for myself.

I've tried to help in the most supportive, non-judgmental ways that I can but I'm getting nowhere and I want to try everything before I just spit it out exactly as I see it.

She does weight watchers about 1/10th of the time and struggles to stick with it, often falling off the wagon within a couple days. I've told her that weight watchers isn't anywhere near as successful as its portrayed and she's been through it like 20+ times so clearly its not a feasible option for her.

I've given advice on foods to avoid like breads and sugars but she doesn't change her diet. She'll also get defensive if I try and talk to her about her choices in high calorie food.

On top of all that she hasn't worked out since early 2020 and has an aversion to it despite saying that I'll go to the gym with her.

If I were to guess I'd say she's up approximately 100+lbs since we started dating. Being honest I'm finding myself much less attracted to her and the lack of effort isn't helping. I should also note that she wants to lose the weight but doesn't want to change the diet or exercise to get her there.

Has anyone been in this situation that has any advice on how to attack this? I don't want to end things but I'm running out of options here.

Tldr; My gf has an unhealthy relationship with food which she defends and reinforces when challenged on it, its lead to noticeable weight gain over time, I've used up all options I know of to try and help and now I don't know how to approach it.",lat8i8,n/a,2021-02-02 11:08:28

**I've been making food for a girl I like, turns out she's been throwing it all out**

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Original Post (wayback machine)](https://web.archive.org/web/20241123190827/https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1gy39kq/ive_been_making_food_for_a_girl_i_like_turns_out/): **November 23, 2024**

I have no where else to talk about this so I'm coming to Reddit. I (21M) am in college, and there's this girl that I'm sort of head-over-heels for. We have a couple classes together and I know some of her friends so we see each other and hang out a lot. I thought there was something between us but I guess I was wrong. I knew she'd been going through a tough time with some family issues lately and I thought she might appreciate not having to worry about cooking while she's worried about all of that, so I've been making her some meals and giving them to her when I see her, usually after class. Food isn't necessarily my love language, I just like to make sure the people I care about are happy and fed.

Well, I was catching up with some of our mutual friends, a couple of whom live with her, and they told me that she either usually throws out the food or gives it to her roommates. I don't think she's eaten anything I've made for her. She always says ""Oh, you didn't have to do that"" all sheepishly when I give her the meals I made, I just figured she was being bashful. I wish she would have just told me to stop so I could've saved some time and energy. I don't know, I'm just upset. I'm not sure where I stand with her now.

Edit: Some context I said in a comment that people said I should add to the original post:

Her friends encouraged it!! I'm very close friends with many people in her close circle and they knew what I was doing, they said it was sweet. I understand now that it was kinda weird and I probably should've stopped. But, I would also say that we're friends rather than acquaintances, we've hung out one on one in the past (which she initiated). I think she just might see me as a friend, which is totally fine, and the message about not just giving people food is 100% heard on my end. I just hated to think that she was stressed and going hungry (she's confided to me in the past that she struggles to make time to eat when under stress).

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** They're being creepy and she doesn't know what's in it. Could be nice quality ingredients, could be blood and semen. Stalkers do weird shit, and op sounds a little stalkerish.

> **OOP:** I mean yeah. As a man sometimes I am not super acutely aware of what a woman might make of a certain situation, and I understand that this thought process is necessary given what women go through. While I had no bad intentions, she couldn't know that for sure. I'll back off. I will say though that her roommates that I'm friends with did encourage it originally, but I realize now it's because they got to eat the food I made.
**Commenter 2:** Just curious; how did you know that she was having family issues and what do you tell her when you give her the food?

It sounds like you interact with her friend group but on an acquaintance base level. How close are you with her and her friends?

> **OOP:** We're friends, I originally knew her through our mutual friends but we hang out one on one sometimes. She told me about what she has going on in her life.

**Commenter 3:** That’s not how it’s done buddy. You ain’t getting love in exchange for food, women aren’t dogs.

> **OOP:** I mean I don't want anything in exchange. This wasn't really an attempt to woo her, I just wanted to make sure she had enough to eat while she was dealing with all this. She's told me and our mutual friends in the past that she struggles to eat when she's stressed. just really care about her and was just trying to help reduce some of her mental load while she's going through a tough time. Regardless of whether or not she likes me, we are friends and I do care about her.

**Commenter 4:** Depends where you're from. There are parts of the world, and the US, where the norm/culture is to give someone a meal if they're struggling with a life event like a death in the family.

> **OOP:** My family is Ukrainian (I was born there) and food is for sure equated to caring over there. I can't count the amount of times I might've told my Baba that I was stressed/tired/upset and I had a plate of food put in front of me as a sort of ""I'm sorry you're dealing with that"". I'm sort of similar where I trend on the skinny side (especially when I'm not doing super well), so I always appreciated being fed.

So, I heard you guys loud and clear that I might've overstepped on this one. Since me and this girl are friends, and I'm super close with a lot of her friends, I figured last night I would text her and apologize. Just because of class and me being at her apartment to see her roommates I'm friends with and whatnot, I know I'll still have to be around her in the future. I made it clear that she didn't even ever have to speak to me again, and that I just wanted to let her know I was so sorry. The conversation went way better than I thought, and it's safe to say we're still on good terms. I figured I'd share this to give everyone closure.

**Transcript of the text messages**

**OOP:** Hey, I just wanted to reach out and let you know I found out you've been getting rid of the food I've been giving you. If what I've been doing made you uncomfortable I just want to apologize, because that was never my intention. I've realized that it was a little much and I should've asked if that was something you were okay with. You don't have to keep hanging out with me, or even respond to this message, I just wanted you to know I'm sorry that I likely crossed a boundary with you. 

**Friend:** hey hey!!! you didn't make me uncomfortable at all:) i just have kind of a funky relationship with food and i struggle eating things that i didn't make myself. honestly i totally owe YOU an apology for not explaining because i understand you went through the effort to do that for me, and me not eating the food but still accepting it might feel like a slap in the face. in my defense the food mostly went to my roommates, the only times i've thrown it out is when no one got to it before it got too old. i think it was really sweet that you were thinking of me like that :) i was worried that telling you to stop would put you off hanging out with me 

**OOP:** Ah, that is so good to hear. So maybe we skip the food and just hang out next time? I'll be back at school Dec. 1st

**Friend:** yes let's do it!!!

Edit: I love how most of Reddit told me to apologize to her and never speak to her again on my last post, and now I'm getting clowned for doing exactly what you guys told me. Pick a struggle lol

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I forgot how much guys just straight up don’t listen to women. We’re not puzzles and many of us speak literally. “You didn’t have to do that” literally meant “you didn’t have to do that.” You were so dialed in on how you feel that you didn’t take hers into account.

> **OOP:** She literally smiled and said ""awww, you didn't have to that"". People say that when they're bashful. If a man said that, we'd all assume he was being polite and bashful. If she wanted me to stop, she should have made it clear. It doesn't matter now because I already posted an update, your comment just rubs me the wrong way.

Just finished reading and I feel like this is going to affect my relationship with food,"I have ARFID, which is an anxiety-based eating disorder that manifests similarly to the kind of picky eating you see in young kids. I have a decent list of safe foods, but getting myself to try new foods is really difficult, and a lot of what I eat is extremely plain.

Seeing Dungeon Meshi get popular on Tumblr, I decided to give it a try, partly because it seemed like something I'd really enjoy, but also because... I mean, it feels a little silly to say, but I thought reading a story about getting adventurous with food might be good for me?

And I'm kinda shocked by this but it like. Kinda worked???? I don't know for sure if I'll be able to follow through, because sometimes I just physically cannot force myself to bite into something that feels unfamiliar or off, but I've started thinking about stuff I might actually be willing try, and I'm really excited about it. Nervous! But excited.

I know this probably seems like such a tiny step, but right now I'm psyching myself up to try adding lettuce to my burgers. Usually I eat them completely plain aside from cheese :') It's a bit embarrassing being 21 years old and afraid of a leaf... I know it's illogical, but that doesn't stop my brain from stressing out about it. Just thinking about trying that change honestly makes me feel like I'm going to cry, but I'm really determined to give it a shot, and I've never felt this much conviction to try something new without being encouraged to by someone else. So! That's pretty big!

I don't have much of a conclusion here, I just wanted to share because 1) I felt like doing so would make it harder for me to chicken out? But also 2) it felt very in the spirit of the manga, I guess. Especially with Izutsumi's whole arc... I could very much relate.

To open the floor to actual discussion here, though... Does anyone else feel like Dungeon Meshi has impacted their relationship with food?

Edit: Thought I'd come back and let you all know... I did it! Sort of! I started thinking too hard about the lettuce and scared myself, but a friend of mine suggested I take a smaller step by adding a vegetable I already know I like. So! I just tried spinach on my burger!!! And I liked it!! :D",1ca396g,n/a,2024-04-22 05:55:59
Rant: (TW: ED discussions)  I want customers to stop making their unhealthy relationship with food my problem,"EDIT: yes, i understand that im going to hear about food while working in food service, but im also allowed to yap and complain on the internet about the way some customers choose to make a big deal about how they want to be mariah carey level skinny legends.

Its officially ""New Years Resolution: Lose weight"" season and 6 days in I'm already at my limit with it. I'm in recovery for an eating disorder, and hearing ""can i get a SKINNYYYYYYY vanilla latte? (which by the way, has 0 meaning! thats not a menu item! what milk do you want! sugar free? less pumps? just tell me what you want)"", ""how many calories is in that?"" ""Ugh, thats sooo much sugar and so unhealthy and gross"", is so... uncomfortable. To clarify, im not talking about people who just ask for nonfat/sugar free, or asking to reduce the amount of pumps, im talking about customers who feel the need to moralize it or make it very clear that theyre restricting their calories. ESPECIALLY if they are actively negatively talking about their body in front of their kids as they place their order. I understand that some people are on a weightloss journey, some people might be diabetic and cant have sugar, that isnt my business. Today i had a customer who decided it was appropriate to lecture me for about 5 minutes about how disgusting she thought the amount of sugar in the peppermint mocha was, and how people just ""dont care about their bodies anymore, and i wouldnt be caught dead drinking that disgusting sh!t"". I! Do! Not! Care! Just order what you want and move on! I don't want to hear about it! The person behind you who is looking forward to their peppermint mocha who now feels embarrassed doesnt want to hear about it! Maybe make your new years resolution to focus on positive aspects of life, not the negative!",1hvd3b5,n/a,2025-01-06 23:22:27

"“Fast metabolism” is a lie, stop making yourself feel bad.","I have a very skinny friend who has claimed to have a “fast metabolism”. She’s always been the type to brag and say “I don’t know how I’m not fat, I eat WHATEVER I want and just don’t gain weight. I don’t even work out either, I spend the whole day on my computer”. Obviously when I was naive, hearing that would make me feel like dog shit and question my own genetics. It made me jealous because I believed it, as everytime we would hang out and go to restaurants, she would order burgers, fries, pizza, everything that isn’t considered low calorie. She would also eat anyone’s leftovers if they didn’t want them. So essentially, she was consuming 2000+ calories every time we would meet up which made it more believable. 

However, I soon learned the truth when I moved in with her for 2 months as a roommate. Yes, she did eat high calorie foods everyday, but I noticed she really only ate 1 meal a day and maybe 2 small snacks usually both below 200 calories in between. And while she did spend a lot of time being sedentary, she was also the type to frequently pace around the house while listening to music or being on a phone call. She’d also walk her dog 1 hour a day which she wouldn’t consider “working out”. So in reality, she really wasn’t eating as much as she claimed she was, and the small habits of pacing around and walking the dog basically kept her at maintenance, hence why she would never gain weight.

Unless they have hyperthyroidism or some other health condition that seriously makes them not gain weight, most people who claim to “eat whatever” and not work out and still can’t manage to gain weight in reality do not eat as much as overweight people would and are ignorant about what “eating a lot” actually means. Or they have certain habits that unknowingly burn calories throughout the day. Most people who are overweight or obese get to that point because our relationships with food is messed up, while theirs is normal. Food isn’t a priority for them, and that’s the biggest difference ",1lr1dw5,n/a,2025-07-03 21:26:43

AITAH for telling my wife to stop making her eating disorder obvious to the kids?,"
My wife Alice has an eating disorder basically her whole life. She doesn’t allow herself anything with too many carbs or sugar in it. Her meals are mostly veg and protein. 

When we first started dating, she was so motivated to change that about herself and develop a healthier relationship with food. She started seeing a therapist and a doctor and was doing really well. She came a really long way and I was doing whatever I could to support her. But when we had our two daughters (8 and 10), she went right back to square one because she was insecure about her body. She completely refused to get any help after because she didn’t want to gain weight. I’ve done everything I could to try help her but she’s completely against it now. 

My daughters and I usually have the same thing for our meals and Alice eats the low carb low fat version of it. Recently, our 10 year old expressed that she wants to start eating what Alice has and she’ll give reasons that sound like exactly what Alice would say. For example, one night we were having rice, salmon and veggies for dinner. My daughter said “dad don’t put rice on my plate, I’ll be bloated tomorrow”. I asked her why she said that and she couldn’t give me an answer. She completely refused to have the rice and I obviously can’t force her, but she’s been doing it more often lately. I sat her down and explained that carbs aren’t bad for her and it’s essential to her growth and health that she has a balanced diet. I thought she understood what I was saying but it hasn’t helped one bit because she still refuses to eat any rice/potatoes/bread or snacks at all.

I told my wife that she needs to stop making comments about her appearance and labelling certain foods as bad because it’s affecting our daughter and I’m scared what level this could get to for such a young child. My wife said “oh sorry, let me just switch my eating disorder off for you darling, didn’t realise it was such an inconvenience”. This ticked me off and I told her to stop being sarcastic and passive aggressive. I said I’m genuinely worried about our daughter and we need to do something to nip it in the bud before it gets worse for her. She said I’m daft for bringing that up with her when she struggles with food too. She said “if I knew how to help someone who struggles with food, I wouldn’t have spent my entire life struggling”. 

My mind is a jumbled mess. I think Im just going to seek help on how to help my daughter and do it on my own but I feel like we won’t make progress if my wife keeps making comments about food in front of her.",18fcyk4,n/a,2023-12-10 20:46:28

This is going to be such a “suffering from successful” post, but bear with me for a second.


I’ve known him for 5 years, different classes and courses but same friend group. Over time, he has genuinely become one of the best people I know, and it’s only getting better everyday. I can’t lie and say he’s not my type; nerdy, charming, sweet, funny, flirty with the right amount of awkward. He comes pick me up from class. Plays hockey without being a douchebag to the skaters. And most importantly, gets treats for my cat. Multiple strangers have mistaken us for a couple, even close people like our friends, professors, and worst of all, my family. He’s kinda perfect, but I’ve never even thought of putting the moves on him, he’s never shown romantic interest in me, we’re friends, nothing more.


Or that’s what I thought.


Today, he was spending the afternoon at my dorm, something he started about a year now. We’re laying on my bed mindlessly watching sonic cartoons when he says (verbatim) “So, baby, where do you wanna go this friday?”


Matter of fact, this is the first time I’ve been called baby by him, so that kinda shocked me. Instead of asking why, I froze and was just like “What’s happening friday?”


He turns to me and KISSES ME (again, first time thing with us), hugs my waist and goes “Our 1 year anniversary, idiot. I’m making reservations.”


At this point, I’m frozen. I genuinely don’t know what to say. I’m gobsmacked. The dude I thought was my best friend, who never even showed interest in the dating thing, is under the idea that we’ve been dating for a whole year. I’m silent while he continues hugging me and scrolling on his phone, racking my brain thinking about what to tell him when his phone starts ringing. It’s his mom, which he puts on speaker and she deadass goes “Hi. Are you still with your girlfriend?” Oh, so now his mom thinks we’re dating too?! He tells her yes, asks why she called. She asks for his help with private stuff I will not divulge here, he turns to me and goes “Sorry, I’ll be back in a bit, sweetheart.”


I just nodded. I was just like “Alright, see you in a bit.” No questions, no screaming, just acceptance. He gets up to put on his sneakers and leans down to kiss me again, which I just accept at this point. It’s a nice kiss besides the fact that my mind is somewhere else. He leaves and I get a text from his coach “Tell (boyfriend’s name) to come tomorrow at 19, he’ll only listen if it’s you” Tf you mean only me?! You’re the responsible adult tasked with training these hockey players, why do you depend on me bringing him to you?! But that led me to a rabbit hole of finding out who knows we’re dating. Apparently, majority of the people I talk to think we’re dating, or if I’m being correct here, KNOW we’re dating, and just, have never mentioned it to me…


I don’t think it’s a prank solely on the fact that his mom called me his girlfriend. They don’t have the closest relationship. She is a very traditional, conservative and religious korean woman. Always serious and does not play around. When she realized early on that her son did not agree with many of her opinions, she stopped caring for him to the fullest, only keeping it civil for the rest of the family and friends. There’s nothing he could’ve done to have her go along with something like this, especially when she wants him to marry young with a nice korean girl, which I’m not. Also, he just does not seem like the guy to play with people like this. He might be dumb and oblivious, but not horrible.


I don’t know what to do now, I mean, he’s a great guy don’t get me wrong, and if the last 5 years are anything to go by, he would be (is?) a great boyfriend, maybe even in the future a husband. But, I’ve never looked at him that way, so I can’t say I love him. When this occurred, it was like the glass shattered and I saw how differently he looked at me, how he talked and acted, stuff that never changed since the beginning but for some reason I’ve never noticed. I can’t sit here and pretend I love him like that, I wasn’t thinking about him in that sense all this time. But, on the other side, I don’t want to hurt him. He clearly thinks we’ve been together for that long so he has to have strong feelings for me, and I don’t want to step on them and scar him like that.


I can’t just keep dating him though, something that I’ve apparently been doing for a year. I could learn to love him eventually, it wouldn’t take much to be honest, but it wouldn’t be fair to him or me. In my defence, who dates someone and just does not ask them about it. If the roles were reverse and a year ago something happened where I was like “shit, I love him, this was probably a date, we’re probably dating right now” I would’ve confirmed with him or at the very least said something for the following year, not only at the 1 year mark.


I just don’t know what to do. I’m scared and angry, disappointed in myself for not recognizing the situation sooner. Feel like I’m stuck between the sword and the wall. Last thing I want is to hurt him, but I also don’t want to lie to him. How should I go on about this with him?


TLDR: My best friend believes we’ve been dating for a year, alongside our friends and families. He’s never ask me, so now I don’t know the best way to approach him about this. Please help.


Update: Before you comment, I’ve sent a text for us to meet up and I somewhat already know what I’m gonna say to him. I’ll try and do an update post after the 48 hours pass.

Turns out he’s just dumb and sad. Or maybe crazy and psychotic. I did give him way too much benefit of the doubt.


I read a lot of comments and messages that were sent to me privately on what I should do. Big thank you to everyone, majority of you were nice and helpful. Also big sorry for the sweet lady wishing me a happy future marriage, not happening soon. And to the people saying it was fake, if I had created a good love story, I would’ve sold it to Netflix or HBOMax or Wattpad instead of being a loser and asking reddit for fake help.


I brought it up to my psychiatrist, showed her the reddit post I made, a few of the messages I’ve received and she basically had the attitude of “Hey, remember that great guy, well he’s a piece of shit now, so let’s learn about moving on and not reminiscing on a broken friendship” which I think is the best way to go in about this.


Now, tbh I don’t remember much because I wanted to cry from the moment he started talking. Also I was quiet and only spoke very little because I did not want to make a bigger scene than it already was. I just let him talk for a few hours and then dipped. Towards the end, he was shouting and unpredictable, people were looking and I just wanted to go home.


I decided that we should meet up in a public space. Before his practice, I sent him a text and asked if he wanted to meet up at a coffee shop we both know. He called, said yes and “You sound serious, should I be worried?” to which I said “honestly, yes, you should” He told me to stop joking and then went on to his practice. Fast forward a couple hours, I’m sitting there and he comes in, sits in front of me and thanks me for the food I ordered for him. We start eating. I’m a nervous wreck and he realises, which led to him asking “Are you really ok, (My name)? You didn’t seem good a while ago, and from what you said, I’m actually worried now”


So I lay it out on him. I ask him why he thinks we’re dating, why does so everyone else and what led to him thinking that. Now, he’s just quiet and I’m just looking at him not say anything.


Stuff after this is a bit fuzzy because I just wanted to cry. This next shit came very out of the blue for me as well, it´s just fucking weird looking back on it.


He said something like “I didn’t really think we could actually date if I asked you up front” to which I said “that’s how relationships usually work tho, you ask” to which led him on a tangent about women in general. Opinions that he shared with me and said to my eyes with no regret. What I saw in front of me was no longer my best friend of 5 years, it was a boy who grew up to be a man and to have a very damaging idea of women. Stuff that I could assign to immaturity, but he had nicer things to say when he was 14 than what he told me now.


I just interrupted him and asked what led him to think about women this way, since he never let his family, most predominantly his mother (tbh I don’t think even the most conservative women in the world would say what he said, but his mother still has some not so nice beliefs about women) influence him into these antiquated ideas. He was quiet for a while and that did give me some pity, until he opened that mouth of his again “You know, there’s these podcasts.” That let me know everything I needed to. “Oh so you’re a Tate fanboy now?” He starts arguing and yelling that it’s not him but that they know what’s right and wrong, how things should be and to be honest, I’m not really listening to him at this point, I just want to get out of there and cry. I’m listening, but nothing is registering. Some of the milder things he started yelling are about women and our relationship with food and how we should have a limited amount, how we’re so vulnerable and emotional, ready to blame men for everything and how we start yelling at every minute inconvenience (which is funny in hindsight), how menstrual stuff was A HOAX and that I was no doubt lying when I couldn’t walk from my period pains because “I wanted his attention” and that “no girl can possibly feel a greater pain that a man” He also said that when we were talking about his course - something to do with car parts - it was not “cute” and “sweet” of me (let alone women in general) to act dumb and pretend I’m clueless, because that does not make me more appealing (I genuinely don’t fucking know how a car works, my fucking bad)


I tell him that if this is all a big joke, it’s not funny. He interrupts me and talks about how he listens to these men but doesn’t tell anyone cuz he knows I and our friends wouldn’t agree, tells me I’m not a “perfect woman” (whatever that means) but that he would still like to date me but couldn’t tell me because I’d say no and “ruin his fantasy” hmmmm…


Im crying now, and people are noticing, so I just want to get out of there immediately. I tell him (not verbatim, but along the lines) “You’re so fucking stupid, (Name)! You genuinely could’ve dated me, if only you had asked. You could’ve had everything but you started listening to opinions of guys who have nothing. How sad can you be to pull a stunt like this instead of asking like a normal person?” He starts yelling that I’m wrong and they know what is right, starting a whole rant that I don’t have the strength to listen to. I stand up, start walking and he grabs my arm. More people are staring. I tell him to let go and he only does when I threaten to call the police. I left telling him to never speak to me again.


I am now home. I’ve blocked him on everything and told some friends what happened. They were all shocked by how he acted and what he said. One guy did tell me “He was always easy to influence tho”. I asked why they thought we were dating and they told me it was how we acted like a couple (I guess that one is on me) combined with the fact that HE TOLD THEM YES WHEN THEY ASKED and since the behavior checked out, they just never thought to talk about it with me. I’m not responding to any of them right now.


To be honest, I’m moving cities in a few months with my family. I used to cry about it nonstop because I’d have to leave all my friends here, including him and that was the last thing I wanted. Now, I’m kinda glad I don’t have to worry about bumping into him. I just feel distraught, like, that was a nice friendship, it was a pillar of my childhood and now it’s just gone.


He said and did some nasty things, even if it was in the span of a few hours. If up until moving he comes up to me personally or tries to pick me up from class, I’ll repeat that I do not want him in my life anymore. If push comes to shove, I’ll call the police, not that I’d think they’d do anything tho. I’m also sharing my location with both my older brother and father; yes it might be a bit “delusional” and not needed, but you never know.


He was a great guy and we did have a good friendship up until he decided to view women as objects and date one without asking because “he deserves it” I just can’t stop crying. I really thought I knew him, and for him to be able to spew those words and opinions at me like that, stuff he’s always been against from what I remember, it was shocking. It’s only been a few hours but it’s already weird not having that constant text or call happening. I feel like it’s kinda empty but I don’t want someone like that next to me. The worst for me is that I see no change. He has no sisters and his mother does somewhat think that way as well, and so does his father. Maybe coach could help, but idk.


I just feel “betrayed ???”, I guess. It feels stupid to say but it’s true. I mean, I get men like this every single day, every girl does. It goes from professors who know me to drivers who are seeing me for the first time. Comments vary from just telling me I’m pretty to more gruesome stuff, I’m used to it. I just never expected it to be someone so close to me, that I trusted. I don’t know when he started thinking like this but now it has me feeling all gross and dirty. If he thinks like this about me and never said it, I don’t even want to know what he thinks about our mutual trans friend, what his opinions are actually like when he’s always been nice and respectful to her.


It does help me chuckle a bit that some of the things he said were just so textbook misogyny that it seems he learned them on a joker sigma instagram account. That is so stupid it’s kinda hilarious if you omit the part where he said rape is not a real problem.


So, that is that. I thought I had a nice friend by my side, but guess not. Never trust a guy, even if you grew up with him, they’ll disappoint you eventually.


EDIT: You know what, fuck this, some of you guys suck. I thought this was a subreddit to help and give advice and yet im still getting dm´s over this being fake and overall clowning me. Like, im sorry if i write in a weird way, but this shit did happen. Do you guys only believe women when they show up dead in the news? I know it sounds insane, it also did to me. But please mind your words, if you're not gonna say something helpful or nice, don't say anything at all. I'm already having a horrible time with all of this and to have reddit men up my dms saying i lied and discrediting me cuz its not possible he'd do that, shut up, please, im begging you. Should have never posted this here to begin with, might just delete it altogether since apparently men only know how to point and laugh at a woman's experience

AITA for taking the vegetables of my kid's burgers?,"I (39 F) have 3 kids, 6 F, 9 M, and 12 F. My husband (40 M) and I decided a few days ago to take the kids to our local restaurant, as a treat, because we don't do that often. My husband is a bit of a health nut, and is VERY restrictive of the foods my kids eat, which is the main source of our arguments.

On Thursday, we went to the restaurant, and the kids were super excited. The server was asking what the kids wanted, when my 12 year old (We'll call her Emily) said, ""Cheeseburger with bacon"". My husband butted in and said, ""With lettuce and tomato"" Emily's face immediately fell. My husband didn't even notice, and Emily looked super bummed.

After the sever took our orders, my husband turned to Emily, and asked her what's wrong. She said that she didn't want lettuce and tomato on her burger, because she doesn't like them. He sighed and said that that they've been through this a million times, and having vegetables with every meal was super important. Emily looked like she was about to cry. She is neurodivergent and a lot of food taste's and textures really bother her, tomatoes being a large one. My husband doesn't seem to care, which REALLY bothers me.

When the food came, Emily didn't even touch the burger. So when my husband went to the bathroom, I took the lettuce and tomato off the burger, put them on mine, and winked at Emily. She grinned and gladly ate her burger. My husband didn't say anything about it, until that night.

He told me that taking the vegetables off was a violation of his trust, because he was just looking out for our daughter. I told him that it was just one meal, and not having vegetables ONCE wasn't a big deal. He said that those vegetables were very important. I left the room, and have been talking to him as little as possible. So Reddit, AITA for taking the vegetables off my daughters burger? I think I might be TAH because it's just lettuce and tomato, and my kids having vegetables is really important to my husband, but I feel like he was being super controlling, and I NEVER want to see my child upset.

UPDATE:

I went to bed when this post had about 200 comments and 50 something upvotes. Now there is 5.8 thousand upvotes, and 1.8 thousand comment. I have been reading through a ton of them, and my heart is breaking for everyone who is sharing their stories with eating disorders and their relationship with food. I have deiced to discuss with my older two about getting into therapy. I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my dick for a husband. Divorce is a serious contender. I would've considered it sooner, but I always thought that it would be better for the kids if we stayed together. I've now realized that my husband is harming my children in ways that could be life threatening. I'm thinking about taking the kids over to my parent's house for the week, because I don't think I can handle my husband doing this stuff to my babies. Thank you so much for all of your support, and I really appreciate it. I will update later about what I've decided to do.",12nozcp,n/a,2023-04-16 00:44:26
"Do you find keto not just changing what you eat, but your relationship with food?","Feeling a little existential tonight.  I'm a young Gen-X, grew up with Boomer parents who always harped about finishing whats on your plate.  ""We don't throw away food"", ""theres starving children in X country"", likely contributed to an unhealthy relationship with food.  When I first started keto, I still had that mindset of finishing my plate but the longer I do this, I realize I haven't just changed what I eat, I'm also losing that mindset of having to finish.  Now when I'm full, its okay to throw away those last few bites rather than force them down.  If theres enough to make sense to save, it goes in the fridge.  Maybe its just age, but does anyone else find their relationship with food has changed the longer they do this?",1l3mjm3,n/a,2025-06-05 01:11:34
"My boyfriend called me “fucking disgusting” for the way I eat chicken, and I can’t stop thinking about it.","To start. I know I’m being a sensitive bitch. I know he was kidding, but it still bothers me. 

For context, I grew up extremely poor and with not the best parents. This has led to me having a… weird relationship with food. I won’t get into it, but it’s a lot. 

Ever since I can remember, when I eat fried chicken, I eat everything, *except* the bone. Including cartilage, and bone marrow. (It may be fried blood depending who you ask, I don’t know, I’ve never researched it. I just break open chicken bones and eat the inside, lol.) 

He has never given any indication that he minds, and I’ve spoken to him about my sensitivity regarding food. 

A few weeks ago, we were trying to figure out where to eat, sitting on my couch with friends and someone recommended a chicken place nearby and my, slightly drunk, bf said outloud, “ugh, no, [OP] is fucking disgusting when she eats chicken.” And our friends giggled, thinking he was joking. I just went quiet. 

 I tried to talk to him about it, but he just kept brushing me off, and asking if I’m really gonna make a big deal about something he said drunk. 

And honestly, I know it sounds ridiculous, but the more I think about it the more it hurts me, and the more I resent him. As if he doesn’t have gross habits? 

Its honestly just made me notice every single thing he does wrong, or in a way that could even me be seen as wrong, and it makes me want to call him out on it. But I know if I did it would be just to hurt him. I’m angry, and sad, and I think I’m realizing that I have to break up with him.


Editing this in because because I keep seeing the same comments: 1.) I don’t do this in public. He had no reason to be concerned I would do this in front of my friends. 

2.) i chew with my mouth closed. I have table manners. My a difficult relationship with food, I mean that I have trauma regarding my food insecurity as a child, including BED, which I have had under control for around 8 months, but any comments on my eating habits are possible triggers.

3.) I have difficulty letting food go to waste, because I have a deep fear of experiencing that hunger again. Hence bringing home all leftovers, turning my rotisserie bones into broths, and pretty much all my other habits. 

4.) he knows all of this. I am fairly open about my traumas, explaining if he asked, but trying not to bring it up, so I’m not just dumping trauma on him all day. 

5.) I will very briefly explain because I’ve gotten several private messages about it. The reason I was locked in a room without food as a child is because my mother was abusive and child abuse is inherently illogical. Lol. In all honesty I can’t remember for sure, but I think I stole a can of Dr. pepper from her bedroom (we weren’t allowed to have her soda because it was too expensive) ",17nh98q,n/a,2023-11-04 08:33:25
"once i get skinny arms, a flat stomach, thin thighs, look ✨effortlessly skinni✨,regain a healthy relationship with food, start pooping like a normal person, see a therapist to deal with my never-ending issues, and like myself in the slightest, it’s OVER for u bitches 😌💯",,jsuo07,n/a,2020-11-12 13:35:03
Binge-free for 1 month after 8 years of an eating disorder : tips to improving your relationship with food and your body,"Hi! I’m /u/Shinbatsu, and I’m in recovery for an Eating Disorder. This is the longest in my adult life I’ve ever gone without bingeing – at my worst I was bingeing twice a day, maybe at my best it was about once a week but I was also in denial about how frequent/destructive my binges were for most of my life. I’ve been maintaining my weight loss through recovery following Intuitive Eating, and I’ve completely changed how I think about myself and food. I’ve gone from being terrified over food, thinking about it and my body 24/7, to being able to eat whatever I want without fear. I don’t live to eat OR eat to live, I’m somewhere happily between the two!

Over the past few months I’ve amassed a bunch more knowledge talking with my therapist, other ED sufferers, reading, and journaling. I definitely don’t have all the answers, but I’m starting to figure some things out. (The more I learn, the more I realize is out there that I don’t know!) This post ended up quite long, but I worked a bit on the formatting to make it easily readable. It might take multiple readings to digest it all, but its filled with TONS of good information!

My motto is: If I’m hungry and it tastes good, I eat it! If I don't love it, I don't eat it.

**My goal is to help you be a healthier and happier you.** [Here’s my old post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3c743h/f2453_170_1245_455_lbs_obese_healthy_in_2_years/ ) which has more information on the start of my recovery journey, so if you haven’t read it there’s lots of good info there to get you started! I’ve also included a list of good resources at the bottom of this page. 

Here’s a [progress picture](http://imgur.com/0oog7pk) I compiled from digging through my phone backup. I blew my own mind when I saw the changes.

**A special note from me to you:** I don’t know you, and I don’t know what circumstances have led you here, but I am so glad that I could reach out to you wherever you are. Maybe you are at your lowest point, maybe you feel like you’ve got it all figured out, but either way I wanted to tell you that I believe in you. I believe inside every one of us is a golden version of ourselves, like the story of the [Golden Buddha]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Buddha_%28statue%29). You don’t need to become anyone else to reach your ultimate self, you only need to peel away the layers of muck that have accumulated on top of it. **You cannot reach your golden self with negativity, guilt, and shame, you need to love yourself.** It requires a lot of introspection, unburying demons in your mind that are holding you back, and is not an easy task, but I believe in you. This is your life and you’re the only one who can change it – you’re the only you you’re ever going to get! It doesn’t matter that the world is setting us up for failure; living a healthy lifestyle right now is like being a fish swimming upstream. Even if none of what I am saying makes sense with where you are in your journey, I hope that I can plant a seed in your mind that there is a life that **you can live where you aren’t at war with food and your body – it is possible**. 

I’ve heard it said in various places, so I'm not going to claim ownership, but this is the theme for my post: 

##It’s not what you’re eating that’s the problem, it’s what’s eating you. It's not just the food you eat, it's how you eat it.

# Disordered Eating:

**Disordered eating?** Eating Disorders are comprised of disordered eating behaviors taken to the point where it routinely interferes with your life and daily functioning. Almost all of us who struggle with our weight (whether it be losing or gaining) have some disordered eating behaviors, but that doesn’t mean everyone has an ED!  For example, my ED made me incredibly isolated, anxious, obsessed with food, unable to function properly at my job and was messing with my relationship. 

**Some behaviors may seem harmless** and many individuals who have been on diets have them: obsessively thinking about food and calories, restricting certain foods from your diet, having “good” and “bad” foods, feeling guilty after you’ve eaten bad foods, using the scale as your primary measure of self worth, etc. 

These start damaging our relationship to food, and might lead to **more dangerous behaviors** and thought patterns as well, things like: feeling scared of food, food hoarding, feeling like others are watching you eat, not trusting yourself around food, binge eating, purging after eating (including via exercise), feeling socially isolated because you avoid situations where food is involved, etc. Even if these behaviors haven’t progressed to the point where they cause an ED, noticing where you struggle is the first step towards a healthier relationship with yourself and food.

# Mental Health 

Mental health is THE MOST important thing to reaching and maintaining health and happiness. I can’t stress this enough. Your body and your mind are one. If your mind is miserable, your body will be too. Lasting change can only come from the inside out. 

**Sleep and water:** Getting a proper amount of sleep and consuming water are core to keeping your body and mind functioning properly. For me, I’d rather sacrifice some exercising time to ensure I get proper sleep, because me being underslept means I will be grumpy, miserable, and hangry all day. 

**Introspection/Meditation:** You must be able to connect with yourself and learn from your mistakes. Meditation will help you improve your happiness, relieve stress, can help you sleep better, and make you feel more emotionally stable. I enjoy my meditation through yoga, as well as through the headspace app (both links available at the end) 

**Support System:** Having people who care for you to back you up when times are tough are crucial. Getting rid of people who are bringing you down is also key! Positivity >>> Negativity. My support system is my boyfriend, my close friends (/u/90Days_Lex and /u/kkeller4 !), /r/90DaysGoal, my therapist, and my friends on TwoGrand.  I seriously wouldn’t be here without all of them. 

**Balance:** My therapist gave me a good metaphor for balance in my life - think of yourself as a pendulum. In the natural state you are neutral, and might be nudged through every day events, but eventually you can right yourself back to center. The thing that can throw us off balance the most is ourselves, and it tends to be along the lines of obsession on one end and neglect on the other. I do this with video games all the time, I’ll either be obsessed with it and spending all of my free time on it, then I just stop and never play it again. When you swing too far to one side of the spectrum, like restriction of food, eventually it’ll have to go back the other way, and the harder you swing to one side, the harder you’ll swing the other way. (I’ll talk about the binge eating cycle in the next section) The same thing can happen with overexercising – the harder you push yourself to exercise, the more likely you are to burn yourself out and then end up not wanting to do any activity anymore. Everything in moderation, everything in balance.

# The Diet Mentality – and why you need to ditch it

If you’re anything like me, the word “diet” is pretty unappealing to think about. It’s filled with so many false hopes and promises, and the process itself is so sad; you feel hungry and deprived. Diets make weight loss look easy, but studies have shown diets make you more likely to put the weight back on plus a little extra. Even if you’re not currently on a diet, the fact that our culture pushes the diet mentality onto us makes us perpetually scared of food; this is also damaging our relationship with food and our bodies. 

**Restrict -> Overeat/Binge -> Guilt -> Restrict -> Overeat/Binge -> Guilt…** 

Undereating is a form of temporary starvation. Undereating will eventually cause you to overeat. Why? 
You're creating the perfect storm for overeating/binge eating. You let yourself get ravenously hungry, you restrict, and you have all these forbidden foods making you psychologically primed to devour them. 1. You restrict, maybe this works for weeks/months then you 2. overeat/binge. 3. “I failed, I have no willpower, I can't trust myself, this is why I'm fat..”. So you 1. restrict harder, you don’t trust yourself around food because you feel so out of control. The cycle repeats. **The issue isn’t your willpower; you can’t fight biology**. We’re built to survive periods of famine by seeking out high calorie food and eating a bunch of it, and your body doesn’t understand the difference between self-induced famine and real famine!

**Patterns of the chronic dieter:** worries about deserving food, guilty feelings about food and eating, “good” and “bad” foods, thinks food is the enemy, eats based on food rules, restrict-binge cycle, focuses on calories burned via exercise, feels guilty when missing exercise, judges progress and body based on weight, when failure occurs blames lack of willpower, consistently second-guesses body cues, ignores feelings of hunger. 

**Healthier patterns:** “Am I hungry? Do I want it? Does it taste good?” Focuses on how exercise makes you feel, weight doesn’t matter with progress, trusts self around food, and recognizes body cues for hunger and fullness.

# 10 Steps working towards the goal of a healthy relationship with food and our bodies:

1.**No more diets**: say goodbye to all types of dieting, if my points above haven’t driven home how ineffective they are, look at your own history with diets. Diets don’t work.

2.**Change your lifestyle**: tweak the way you cook, eat more veggies and protein, change your portion sizes, find activities you enjoy, build good habits slowly over time, but DON’T give up what you love! Focus on what you can *add* to your diet, not what you take away.

3.**Identify your issues**: Are you one of the many who have a problem with emotional eating? Do you eat too much when there’s free food around? Or is food just being in proximity to you mean its fair game? Do you demonize “unhealthy” food and then crave it and binge on it later? Figuring out where you’re going wrong is one of the first steps to healing because you’ll be more aware of it. 

-	**Don’t eat your feelings**: Because this is such a big issue for so many people, I wanted to make an extra section for it. Becoming more in tune with your body will help you identify emotional hunger separately from physical hunger. Emotional eating is not just eating when sad, its eating to avoid your feelings, eating when bored, when angry, frustrated, excited, stressed, anxious, for social connection, etc.  For me, emotional hunger is sharp and painful, where physical hunger is much more prolonged in onset. Once you can identify your emotional hunger, you’ll need to remind yourself that food does nothing to solve the problem. You need to ask yourself what’s really bothering you, and try to do something that is productive in helping solve the problem! If it’s not something that can be actively solved, writing down your feelings in a journal can help too. When I notice emotional hunger, I try to refocus myself with a little meditation and remove stressors from my environment. Find different ways to soothe your emotions when you are troubled; **this void cannot ever be filled with food**. 

4.**Eat when hungry, stop when full** – The mantra of intuitive eating! You will need to reacquaint yourself with what your body is actually trying to tell you. **Listening to your body** is really important because no one knows what your body needs better than your body itself – especially not some diet plan! Too many of us become numb to signals of hunger or fullness and only feel extremes – we work through our hunger, or put it off because it’s inconvenient, then eat ravenously later. Stopping when full means **forget about the clean your plate mentality**.  If you love it, eat it, if you don’t, stop eating. A wonderful thing I've found with trying to practice listening to my body more is the signals I can now distinguish. Thirst and dehydration are very sharp and intense compared to hunger. True hunger is slower and can be postponed, though I try not to. Emotional hunger is an even sharper feeling than thirst!

5.**Make peace with food**:  **no more good food or bad food**, no more forbidden foods, period. There’s a weird psychological effect that happens when we can’t have something, it becomes more and more desirable to us! An example for me was pop tarts and hot pockets. I used to eat these things all the time as a kid, then they became idolized to me as an adult as forbidden foods. When I actually made peace with food and tried these foods again, focusing on the tastes and textures, I realized I don’t even like them and they don’t hold any power over me anymore. You need to slow down and focus on the act of eating, the sensual qualities of the food, to figure out if you actually like that food or not! For me it turned out that hot pockets are greasy and unsatisfying, and pop tarts are sugary cardboard. 
There’s two big voices in your head that are going to be important to making peace with food : the “food police” and the nurturer. 

- You need to **dismiss the food police.** The food police is every externally generated thought (from your parents, from your friends, from magazines, from society in general) about food that has gotten ingrained in your psyche as ultimate truths: don’t eat after 8pm, carbs are bad, fats are bad, cake is bad, salad is good, fruit is good, pizza will make you fat, etc. When you break one of the food police’s rules, the voice will yell at you and make you feel guilty. It is a completely negative voice that won’t help you reach your goals. When you notice this voice coming up in your head, challenge it. There are no rules with food that are ultimate truths! 

- The next thing that will help is **embracing the nurturer** . The note I wrote to you at the beginning of this post is the voice of the nurturer, it is the caring loved one who will never give up on you. It’ll help you push through the toughest of times. I didn’t have a strong nurturer voice, but I’ve worked on building it up by imagining it’s the voice of my boyfriend and best friends: what would they say to me when I’m struggling?

6.**Trust yourself**: You need to start rebuilding trust with yourself and food. You won’t become an unstoppable bingeing monster if someone puts you in front of your favorite food, I promise. The thing that makes you binge is the forbidden foods and letting yourself get ravenously hungry – if you can tackle these two issues, you can start to trust yourself around food. It might be really hard and scary at first, but each successful experience builds on the others. For me one of my first instances of this was pouring my cereal without measuring it. I guess I just didn’t trust myself to pour a normal amount of food. However, such a small thing had such a big impact, and now I don’t measure my food anymore and I’m building a strong foundation to trusting myself.

7.**Find Satisfaction** - If you ate 2000 calories tomorrow comprised entirely of broccoli and baked chicken breast, you might be physically full, but something in you would feel lacking – that’s satisfaction. There is a balance we must strive for in healthy, filling foods, while also keeping ourselves satisfied. A big key to this puzzle is to **honor your cravings.** Not only will satisfying your cravings make you physically happy, but it is likely to make your body happy too! You might not understand some weird cravings your body has, but it might be seeking out a specific nutrient or macronutrient. You might be like me and end up chasing your cravings if you don’t honor them, trying to constantly substitute healthier things for what I crave, but then some nights it ends up me eating a little bit of everything in my kitchen AND finally caving into a cookie instead of just satisfying myself with a cookie in the first place! If you honor your cravings you'll likely end up eating less overall. We're taught to beat up on ourselves and not enjoy the forbidden foods. If the food isn't forbidden anymore, you're allowed to eat it whenever you want, you'll find yourself satisfied with a much smaller amount and you won't feel out of control around the food. Feeling pleasure from eating is a good thing. If you're satisfied now, you’ll be happier overall and you'll eat less later.

8.**Honor your body with Exercise:** So many people see it as something they *have* to do instead of something they *want* to do. Exercise was the only way I was able to get back in touch with my body and feel alive, instead of like I was trapped in my body and mind all the time. **You can’t have a healthy relationship with exercise if the only reason you do it is to burn calories.** For me the things that keep me going are: Running makes me feel powerful, strong, relieves stress, helps me sleep better, and like I can put my mind to something and do more than I ever thought was possible. I couldn’t even run in 2014 now I can go 14 miles! Yoga helps me feel in touch with my body in ways that nothing else can. Exercise shouldn’t be such a chore that you feel like you need to reward yourself whenever you do it. Not only are you setting yourself back, it just makes your relationship with exercise and food worse. If you must reward yourself, find something non-food related, like a bath or pedicure! If you’re not happy with the exercise you’ve chosen, try another! Maybe you’ve been **over-exercising** and lost touch with why you enjoyed your activity in the first place. I got dangerously close to letting over-exercising destroy my body; it took my therapist and boyfriend giving me some harsh words for me to finally cut back and reconnect with the part of running that I love. Now I run 4 days a week, and I’ve banished self-destructive, painful runs! 

9.**Honor your body with Nutrition:** Once you’ve dismissed the food police, nutrition will be your ally. Instead of making you feel guilty, you will be able to make informed food decisions for your health. For example: choosing between two types of cheese, one has twice the saturated fat of the other, so you decide to choose the lower saturated fat cheese for your health. Or maybe you’ve decided you’d rather have high fat/low sugar yogurt over low fat/high sugar yogurt because the higher fat helps you stay full longer and doesn’t make your blood sugar spike and crash so hard.

10.**Love yourself.** You can either be your best ally or you're worst enemy. You are the only you you'll ever get and there are no rerolls in life, so don’t take it for granted! **If you only make cosmetic changes in your life you're only going to see cosmetic results that fade as quickly as washing off make up**. Nourish yourself physically and mentally and you'll start to shine from the inside out.

# The Numbers Game: 

Numbers do something weird to my brain, as I’m sure they do to others as well. I think this is because my brain sees the number as black and white, either I hit the number or I fail: weight, calorie counting, macros, TDEE. Some people are able to maintain a healthy relationship with the numbers, but for other people this is near impossible. In order for me to recover, I had to break away from the numbers.

**You deserve happiness, not when you hit some arbitrary weight, you deserve happiness right now.** 

**Goals:** What is your goal? This is /r/loseit so I’m guessing it’s “I want to lose weight” … but why? If your goal is simply to lose weight, what do you do when the weight is lost? I think the reason most people gain weight back once they hit their goal is because they set their goal as the endpoint without thinking what comes after. This also seems why weight loss as a goal is incompatible with ED recovery; if your goal is to lose weight, you can’t just stop losing weight because that’s what motivates you, and then you end up in a dangerous place because you only know how to lose weight to be happy. 

**The journey doesn’t end because the journey is your life**. Maintenance isn’t the endpoint – it’s another journey! Lots of other things will happen along the journey of your life. How will you look 5 years from now? 10? 20? How will you feel when you get wrinkles? When your skin sags? When your hair turns grey? Will your self-worth still weigh so heavily on what the scale says? 

**The scale does not reflect body composition.** My focus on weight loss for weight loss sake made me miserable. I had to become happy from the inside out, and then my body followed. I ditched my worship of the scale in order to start a new relationship with my body and redefine what it means to me to be healthy. Besides, 90-95% of scale changes day-to-day are due to water weight, poop weight, or food weight. 
 
What would I recommend for you? **Create a goal that is not to lose weight for the sake of losing weight / being thin**, because this focus is on the wrong thing. For example, make respecting your body and mind the primary goal! In recovery I learned that there were many better reasons for me to engage in behaviors that help my health and happiness than just weight loss: I want to live a long life, to have more energy, to not feel like a prisoner in my body, to feel comfortable in my own skin, to be happy, to run further and faster. Those motivations carry me through the “so what happens after you’ve lost the weight” phase and they keep me going strong every day! You need to accept that weight loss might not come at a steady pace when its not your goal, but that’s ok. So what if you gain weight? Maybe you gained muscle AND lost fat, wouldn’t that be a great thing? This will help you not feel like you’re at war with your body too. 

**Calorie counting:** It isn’t necessary to reach your goals. It can be helpful, but for some people it isn’t feasible without becoming obsessive. I’d highly recommend the app TwoGrand for those in situations like me – it’s a photo food journal that has a strong social component.  Taking a picture of the food you’re about to eat might not seem like a revelation, but it does some crazy things to your mind: you can’t lie when you post the picture, you reevaluate if you’re really hungry, you think “why am I eating this? What purpose does it serve? And do I really want to post a picture of this?”  It’s the best stepping stone I’ve found on the road to intuitive eating.

# “Every bruise is a lesson” – Arya Stark

**How to deal with failure:** Everyone fails because no one is perfect. Failure doesn’t exist for you to feel bad about it, dwell on it, and get depressed. You can use any instance of failure to learn from it. For example, for me I had a bad binge at a party where there was buffet style desserts and a lot of alcohol. I learned that those environments are extremely hard for me to not binge in, and when possible I should take my food onto a plate and move to another room where there isn’t food present so I don’t stand there and graze while talking. Drinking also makes me even less in touch with my satiety mechanisms, so I try to moderate my alcohol a bit more than just drinking freely. 

**Trials and tribulations make you into the amazing person you are today.** I am who I am because of the struggles I’ve overcome in my life. If I didn’t go through the emotional abuse I did as a child, there’s a large probability I wouldn’t be so kind and compassionate today. 

**Show yourself some compassion:** I really like this quote from a TED talk I watched, “If you talked to other people like you talk to yourself you wouldn’t have any friends.” It’s important to learn from your failures, but don’t ruminate on them for longer than that. Life isn’t black and white. Get rid of perfectionist thinking: **You aren’t perfect or a failure**. This will make you spiral hard and sabotage yourself. 

**Your body deserves at least a basic level of respect** (like you’d give your pet) – to be fed an appropriate amount of nutritious food (not just junk), to be comfortable, to receive a minimal amount of physical activity, and to avoid harassment for never being perfect. What I say by comfortable may not make sense, but imagine you had a dog that was overweight, would you let its fur get matted and not trim its nails because its overweight? Would you not give it belly rubs until it lost weight? You deserve to groom yourself to whatever standard you would normally have for yourself, you deserve comfortable clothes, your body deserves to be treated nicely - get a massage, take a bath, get a manicure for example! **Stop body bashing**, it will make it impossible to respect your body. Every time you think negative thought about your body, try to replace it with a positive statement – focus on a different part of your body that you like, or what the body part you don’t like has done for you instead of just focusing on its aesthetics. 

Here are some common **cognitive distortions** you may have. These played a large role in my anxiety and my eating disorder, and tackling them has been EXTREMELY important: 
	
•	**Polarized Thinking** - black and white, good food or bad food, eating nothing or eating everything, perfectionism or failure. There is no middle ground, but the world doesn’t work like this – everything is a shade of grey. Break this habit and when you notice yourself with thoughts that are repetitive and have the words ""must"", ""always"", ""never"", ""only"" - challenge them and replace them with more accurate thoughts!

•	**Catastrophic thinking** - thinking to the extremes (these are all things I've said in the past): ""this is hopeless"", ""I'll always be a fat failure"", ""my life is ruined because I gained two pounds"", ""If I let myself have one slice of cake I'll eat the whole thing and be a fat whale"", ""my boss is so mad at me I'm definitely going to be fired."" Catastrophic thinking turns a small bad thing into a black hole where you have no hope of climbing out of, you need to notice when you're starting to have catastrophic thoughts and try to replace them with more positive and accurate thoughts. 

•	**Pessimism** - seeing the worst part of every situation, this kind of thinking can suck any happiness out of you because everything seems negative. You condemn your progress and can't notice your successes. For example, maybe I ate badly once this past week, and I tell myself ""I'm awful, I had a terrible week,"" when more accurately and optimistically I should say ""I messed up once this week, but I did so well at many other occasions."" 

•	**Linear thinking** - the goal is the object of our desire, the faster you lose the weight the better, anything else is failure. Whenever things don't progress linearly as you expect, your goal is at stake and you feel awful. Instead try process thinking - focusing on the journey and not the destination. You'll notice the things you've learned along the way and it will help you stay more positive.

My daughters eating disorder is killing me financially.,"My daughter hates food. I think she has arfid but I've been ignored by countless doctors so fuck me, I guess. She had a three day anorexia workshop (which did absolutely nothing).

She's always hungry but won't eat. She's gone weeks. If you give her food she likes she'll eat until it hurts - but the food she likes is so expensive. I'm living on plain rice this week just to afford her food. Literally three times a day. My son hates her because of the food. I've applied for financial assistance so many goddamn times. I work over forty hours a week and after bills I barely have £70. At least fifty goes on feeding her and it never lasts her that long. 

I am so tired. I'm hungry. My son fucking hates his life and he's told me so many times how much he wishes we could just let her starve. 

I'm going to drag them both in to the doctor tomorrow, have them express their feelings, be called a bad mother and go home to a freezing house because we can't afford to eat and have heat.

I fucking hate my life. What did I do to deserve this?",1ajo6lf,n/a,2024-02-05 18:50:20
So eating disorders really fuck your body up.,"I've only been restricting to >!1000!< calories and purging anytime I go over for a couple of weeks. I feel like absolute fucking shit. Woke up this morning with a bit of the spins and feeling dizzy. At times I'm so tired I feel like I could fall asleep standing up. I know I should stop. I've heard the stories and been told of the hell that is eating disorders. Every time the silence hits I just think dear fucking God I'm slowly killing myself. But I don't want to stop. 

I keep telling myself I'll stop once I look how I want. I know that's a lie but I keep believing it. It's what everyone says. I'll stop at x point. It won't happen to me. I'll stay safe while doing it. All lies. Last night, I thought about trying to go lower than >!1000!< calories. Maybe I can find a way to work in all essential nutrients and vitamins in >!800!< calories. I'm literally creating an eating disorder, and I don't know how to stop, and part of me doesn't want to. 

I finally feel in control, but I hate it. I hate every second of it, but for once, I am in control. For once, I can imagine my body looking how I want it too.

How far this has gotten in just 2 weeks is insane. I'm terrified to see how bad it will be in 2 months. I'm scared this shit is gonna kill me. But I feel like I'm too far gone. Like the second I figured out how to purge it was too late.

Edit: I'm sorry if I did something wrong or offensive. I don't know why I'm being downvoted. I have autism so I get that sometimes I can come off wrong or differently than what I was trying to do. Again, sorry if I did something wrong. That wasn't my intention. If you could let me know what I did so I don't do it again, I'd appreciate it. I just needed to vent my fucked up thoughts. I didn't want to offend or upset anyone or be disrespectful. That wasn't my intention. Im sincerely sorry if it came off differently.",1hpnrl0,n/a,2024-12-30 13:58:45
Eating disorder fetish (trigger warning),"I've had anorexia since I was a teenager (I'm middle aged now) and I've been dating (I know I should get back to full health first), but it's weird to me how many men are fine, even turned on, by it. I've had say things like ""you are like being with a teenager."" Or a guy I dated, when I took a second slice of pizza pie was like ""really? You eat that much?"" Like, dude it's not a rotisserie chicken. It's a slice of pie!

Someone mentioned that there I ED fetish, and just wondering if other women have experienced this?

Edit, if I want a full rotisserie chicken I'm going to have it!",1fpzyx9,n/a,2024-09-26 16:10:54
My eating disorder was a choice.,"I truly don’t understand why most experts on ED’s claim it’s not a choice. I consciously thought about it and chose it. I knew what anorexia was and I literally told myself, “I want to go anorexic for the summer.” I didn’t understand the ramifications or reality, but I chose to not eat for the purpose of losing weight. It wasn’t a diet that got out of control. It wasn’t something I fell into. I chose purposefully to do it. 


I (F20) was 13 when I made this decision. There was something traumatic happening in my life where I was literally physically not in control of my life. And obviously, yes, to cope with that, I restricted. But I didn’t make that connection when it happened. I purely wanted to starve myself to lose weight. Yes, the cause wasn’t my fault. But the way I chose to deal with it, an eating disorder, was a choice. 

This is my long winded way of saying I don’t understand why people say it’s not a choice. I made a choice to “go anorexic.”


EDIT: Thank you for everyone breaking it down. I’m still not exactly sure how I see it, but you’re helping me see it in a different way. I’m taking the phrase a bit too literal, I think. Also thank you to those telling me to be nicer to 13 year old me and being patient",15hlcov,n/a,2023-08-04 00:43:22

Realized I Developed an Eating Disorder - A Word of Warning,"Hello everyone. This isn’t a post meant to discourage anyone losing weight (because you’re doing amazing and I’m so proud of all of you), but is instead a word of warning showing what might happen if you go too hard in your mindset. I’m still in disbelief that I actually have an issue, but certain situations have shed light on the fact that I may have a problem.

I’ve lost a total of about 80 pounds, and my goal weight was (is?) 125 pounds. I’m not quite sure what my exact weight is at this moment, but I’ll guess about 130 pounds, unfortunately. I only say unfortunately because I made it down to ~127 pounds at one point, but recent events have caused me to gain a bit. I usually weigh myself every day (sometimes multiple times a day), but have tried to implement a rule in the past week to only weigh once a week. 

Anyway, I’ll cut to the chase. I lost most of the weight by restricting calories to 1,200 a day and never had a cheat day. I’m surprised I had so much willpower, but I lost 45 pounds in a 6 month time period (the initial 35 came off somewhat slowly a couple years prior to that point). Once I reached around 135 pounds, I began to somewhat maintain and very slowly lose weight. I ate at around 1,500 calories and slowly dropped a few more pounds over the next year. 

About 6-7 months ago, I introduced exercise into my lifestyle. Previously, I HATED exercising. Now I can’t live without it. Starting in January 2019, I began to ramp up the cardio and went every single day for a minimum of 35 minutes (exercise bike). And I’m not just talking about some light cycling here - I do an intensity level of 8-9 at about 18 mph and finish the session dripping in sweat. I started to do some weights here and there, but weightlifting is still something I have yet to fully explore (I really want to get into it though!). During this time, I’ve eaten at sedentary maintenance calories (1,650). A month or two ago, I began to allow myself a bit more on the weekends, jumping up to 1,800-2,000 on those days. However, I felt very indulgent and “fat” doing so.

Unfortunately I’ve had an issue with getting my menstrual cycle (is that TMI? sorry), which apparently may be related to the weight change, calorie restriction, and drastic change in exercise. We aren’t 100% sure yet though. I was eventually referred to an endocrinologist and they found my estrogen levels to be low. I also had a resting heart rate of 41, which freaked me out (that’s not normal, right?). The doctor, after I went over my diet and exercise routine, recommended that I eat more and exercise less for the next 3 months and see if my hormone levels change (and if I get a period). That was about a week ago.

The past week has revealed how much of an issue I have when it comes to controlling what I eat and how much I exercise. I also unfortunately have a problem with binging on cheat days (which don’t happen that often, but when they do, it’s bad). I’ve had a handful of moments since the start of 2019 where I lose all control (this almost always occurs at night on a non-counting day) and eat until I am uncomfortably full and in pain. This is followed by extreme guilt and an unshakeable view that I am overweight and disgusting, despite being a normal BMI. I recently took a trip to Disneyland and had my worst binge ever, which resulted in me throwing up for the first time in over 10 years (if it wasn’t TMI, it definitely is now - sorry). Unfortunately, this past Saturday and Sunday were binge days for me. We’re talking sneak to the fridge at 1am for leftover pizza kinda binge days.

Because of the doctor’s recommendation, I have increased my calorie goal to 1,900-2,000 on days I do the intense cardio, and am going to stick with 1,650 on days I am sedentary. I am also going to take two rest days a week from the gym. I had a “rest day” yesterday, but ended up still walking for about an hour and a half total because I craved the exercise. I made the mistake of weighing myself after the binge weekend and was a total of 4 pounds heavier than I was six days ago. Since then, I’ve been in mental anguish over my weight, and cannot shake the feeling of being fat and stuck. I feel like I can’t just jump back into my extreme routine and get the weight off. I feel like I’m never going to reach my goal. I feel trapped and overweight and helpless.

I am terrified of gaining a significant amount of weight over the next three months, and waver between understanding that it’s okay to eat more when I work out and feeling like a complete pig for doing so. I can’t tell how many calories I’m burning, so I always have felt comfortable “playing it safe” by eating at sedentary maintenance. The weight gain over the past week is definitely going to deter future binges, or at least I hope so. 

Anyway, I guess this is just a story that shows how easy it can be to slip into an unhealthy mindset when it comes to losing weight. The unfortunate thing is I’ve been feeling healthier than I’ve ever been and so proud of my lifestyle, and now that I have to eat more and exercise less I feel lazy and fat. I don’t have an accurate view of what I look like, and my perception of my body would change depending on the number I’d see on the scale that morning (with a pound meaning the difference between feeling skinny or fat). Even typing that out is difficult because I am so convinced underneath it all that I’m right and everyone else is wrong. It’s a very tricky situation, and hard for me to acknowledge. It’s a work in progress.

If anyone else has similar experiences, I would appreciate you sharing them with me if you are comfortable enough. I feel fairly alone in this when it comes to the people I know in real life. 

I don’t know if I’m doing any of this right anymore. I don’t know if I’m eating too much now, or if it’s still too little. I don’t know if I’m cutting out enough exercise, or if it’s safe to increase it a little. I’ve had control for so long and now I feel disgusted with myself and trapped in my situation. I’m not asking for any medical advice or anything like that - I know a medical professional is the one to go to here. I guess I’m just looking for support. Or to feel like I’m not alone, or some kind of freak.

Thanks for listening.

Edit - I feel like it might be helpful to mention that I used to have a very high carb diet, but once I started exercising more I switched over to consuming a diet much heavier in protein/fats. Instead of having a massive carb intake, I now eat at a ratio of 30% carbs, 40% fat, and 30% protein. Some of the foods I eat the most are as follows (I tend to eat a lot of the same thing in my daily routine): nuts (peanuts, almonds, walnuts), deli meat, pepperoni/salami, broccoli, carrots, tuna, beef jerky, oatmeal, greek yogurt, eggs, protein bars... so the worry isn't really how healthily I'm eating.",behbkm,n/a,2019-04-18 04:18:04

Helena's eating disorder is telling us something more sinister,"The intro scene in 2x09 was hard to watch.  
>!When I saw Helena cutting the smallest pieces of her only egg, it reminds me of the huge disgust and desire to gain back control we can see in eating disorders. !<  
>!And then, James ""take them raw"". !<  
It hit me like a car.

We're truly at the beginning of scientific psychology thanks to neurosciences.  
This show had the best way to illustrate complex psychological concepts (severance seems to be the conscious version of dissociation after trauma for instance), and there are many researches about the link between anorexia or eating disorders in general and incest or sexual abuse as a child. (I've put some links below, there are so many studies about that! !)

The worst part ? Sometime the abuse can be an incestuous environment without ""act"". It is called ""moral incest"" or ""emotional incest"".  
Years of putting a child into an adult position, sexual allusions, intimacy violations... (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0222961718301685)

And I think this is what we can see with Helena and James.  
Forcing an adult to work was just the tip of the iceberg. I feel like this season is all about seing the truly evil nature of Lumon (kidnapping, child labor, torture, murders...). And as always, Severance is about showing not telling.

This intro scene once again showed us Helena as the product of years of abuse of so many different forms.

OP Accidentally Trained Her Cat To Be An Eating Disorder Support Pet (July 2021 TrueOffMyChest),"Originally posted by u/moonchild_86 in r/TrueOffMyChest on April 12, '21, updated on July 19, '2.


Trigger Warning: Eating Disorder 


Mood Spoiler: >!Heartwarming & Positive!<


[Original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/mpi934/i_accidentally_trained_my_cat_to_be_an_eating/)
 


I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...


I'm feeling guilty today.


I've had this cat for 3 years now. My Ed got significantly worse about 2 1/2 years ago.


At first, I didn't even realise what she was doing. I had a problem with purging for a long time... She would get between me and the toilet, demanding attention and fuss, while I cried. She would sniff my face and lick it, making it impossible to purge. If I locked her out of the bathroom, she would meow so loudly that I'm sure the neighbors heard.
 

I finally managed to stop purging last year after recovering and relapsing a few times. The lockdowns have been really difficult, and not being able to go to the gym hasn't helped.
 

A couple of months ago, my cat stopped eating. She got so skinny, she was really underweight. Vets couldn't find anything wrong, I hadn't changed her food, there was no reason for it.
 

I'm not sure how it happened... One day, I decided to have breakfast, too. So I sat down with my food and put her bowl next to me. And she finally ATE... I did the same at lunch time. And again, she actually ate.


The same the next day. And the next.


We've been doing it for a while now. She's still underweight, but she's getting there.


I wake up at 7am every day. We have breakfast at 9/9.30. I need those couple of hours to build up to breakfast.


I slept really badly last night. I woke up at 9.10, and I just couldn't do it. Lunch is at 12, I just couldn't eat.


I put Lily's food down by me. She stared at me. Stared at her bowl. Stared at me again. Then walked away.


I'm heartbroken that I couldn't do it for her. She needed me to eat and I let her down...
 

She finally ate at lunchtime. I had a sandwich. She kept glancing at me, pausing for me to continue before she would eat more.

 
People say we don't deserve animals.


I don't deserve this cat. She is saving my life, quite literally, and I don't think anyone appreciates or understands how incredible that is.


It's also absolutely terrifying. I don't deserve this cat...

Thankyou for all the awards btw.



I am part timing in an IT company that is very close knit. My boss Steven and his wife were always sweet. 

It was my first month and it was my boss’s “birthday week” so he and wife Melissa were kind enough to include me in this fancy dinner they were taking everyone to. A week prior to the dinner, Melissa added everyone to a group chat and asked whether we had any suggestions on where to eat. I told her that I am fine with anything as long there are vegetarian options available or at least chicken.

They brought their daughter Stef(15) to the dinner and she is a sweet little girl. Now Stef was really interested in me and she kept on asking me questions about how I look the way I look. Now I am short(5ft) but can be somewhat deemed as “fit” to today’s generation. 

I was transparent with her and told her that I don’t restrict myself to certain foods but rather eat everything in moderation. Plus I have a plant-based diet and home cooked meals so that helps and I also lift weights. Now Melissa overheard our conversation partially. She pulled me aside and told me that Stef was recovering from eating disorder so she encouraged me to be honest with her and not lie to her and not to order anything that screams “diet!”

When I saw the menu, there were little to no vegetarian options available. It didn’t have anything for me. I was very disappointed and made a comment that oh wow there are no vegetarian options. Melissa chimed in and said that eating meat once in a while won’t affect my weight. Now, when I say plant-based diet it’s not that I don’t eat meat but I only eat chicken maybe once a week as a side dish and certain types of fish occasionally but other than that I mostly eat vegetarian dishes. My food habits are not for my “weight” but for my religion/culture. It has nothing to do with my weight. 

When the waiter came in, I was still glued to my menu when all the others had already ordered. Melissa said that oh she will have the duck too and I interrupted and said that no I will have the garden salad(I hate salads but there were no other veg options). 
Melissa got quiet.

After a few mins she told me that I shouldn’t have lied and lead on her daughter if I was going to order a “skinny” salad and starve myself. She said that I am just like those IG influencers who lie to impressionable young girls about their food habits and bodies and I just proved that by ordering a salad after giving her daughter a “don’t restrict yourself” speech and I probably triggered her eating disorder.

I tried to explain that I only ordered a salad cuz there was no other option in the menu for me but then she said that I should have just sucked up and eaten the damn duck as it isn’t going to affect my weight but then again I corrected that it is a religious thing and not a diet thing. She said that if I eat chicken then obviously I would eat other animals too and I was just putting up an act. It was horrible. She completely tore me down and I immediately left",mzletc,n/a,2021-04-27 10:27:57
AITA for having flavored sparking water at my teenage daughter's birthday party? Another mom accused me of trying to give her daughter an eating disorder.," My daughter birthday party was on Saturday morning; she is 13 years old. We just hosted it in our backyard. For food we ordered pizzas, wings, garlic bread, tortilla chips, guacomole, salsa, pasta salad and burgers. When it came to drinks, We had water, sparkling water, lemonade.

So we have the birthday party everything is going well. One of the moms call her Lacy comes to pick up her daughter. She then finds her drinking a La Crouix. She tells her daughter to toss the drink, and then she comes up to me and is like why are you offering diet products to my children.

I’m like it’s just sparkling water, she then flips out saying that her daughter does not need artificial soda replacements. She goes onto say if I want to give my children eating disorders I can do that but not for her children. 

I was taken a back and just how aggressive she was, and I didn’t feel like I did anything wrong. I was like look I have pizza, wings, brownies this is not a diet party at all. She then tells me I have no right to judge what is a diet product or not. She and her daughter both left. Also she later posted on Facebook (I am not friends wit her) that 'some people are trying to push diet products onto children that aren't even theirs.'

FWIW if my children want soda I am cool with them having it in moderation, but none of my children do. And it was just really odd for me too, like I have never heard of anyone say that flavored sparkling water is an artificial replacement for soda?? Also I didn't say anything to her but it was extra odd because both her and her daughter were obese, so its just extra odd they are accusing me of trying to give them eating disorders?",nhxtam,n/a,2021-05-21 17:18:21
Emily is exploiting her child’s eating disorder for job security & it’s disgusting.,"Title pretty much says it all. Starting the season off with that and then the People article following directly after, she is awful. She can scream from the rooftops about how Katie is hurting her family by talking to “bloggers” but that is nothing compared to this. That kid is not nearly old enough to consent to this being shown, and not only will he be bullied for this at school, it will FOLLOW him in his future. It will be the first thing that comes up when you google his name.

TIFU by accusing my son of having an eating disorder.,"So, I like to think i'm an O.K mom. I don't smother my son or let him get too crazy. He's fifteen so I always knock on the door, not just to be respectful, but because there's some things a mom shouldn't see.

Well, yesterday he left to go to the McDonald's across the street with some friends. I assumed he'd be a couple hours so as far as I knew I was alone. I decided to take advantage by putting on some headphones that wouldn't be inevitably tugged on with a ""Mom, can-"" question following.

I'm doing the dishes, sweeping, trash, etc while Metallica is blasting in my ears. I start gathering laundry/putting it away, and unbeknownst to me my son got home earlier than expected.

I decided to toss his gym clothes I just finished washing on his bed while I was putting away my own clothes as our rooms are right next to each other. I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS HOME. I walk straight in without knocking and I'm horrified.

My 15 y/o son is...shoving a spoon down his throat and gagging over a cereal bowl. What the fuck.

He instantly jumps, slowly turns over to me, and the spoon almost comically drops from his mouth. I set the clothes down and in my confusion/horror sit down next to him.

I asked ""What were you doing?"" and he's extremely nervous and keeps repeating ""it's nothing i wasn't doing anything.""

He's on the wrestling team and it clicked in my head *oh shit he was making himself throw up he must be body conscious how did i not notice he was doing this to himself*. 

I start giving a mom speech about how body dysphoria is extremely common in teens and he shouldn't be afraid to ask for help from a trusted adult, that i'm here for him, he's perfect just the way he is. 

He looks like a deer caught in the headlights and remains adamant he wasn't doing anything. I asked ""Is this something you'd rather talk about with (uncle) or (coach)?"" He's exasperated and tense saying there's nothing to talk about.

Finally I just have to say ""It's pretty obvious what you were doing and I need you to be honest with me or someone else so we can figure this out.""

Him: ""I wasn't trying to throw up!""

Me: ""Then what were you doing?""

Him: ""I needed to know if I have a gag reflex!""

I'm extremely confused at this point and ask why. He blurts, ""I'm gay!"" I'm completely shocked and he has tears in his eyes.

It clicks.

I immediately wish I hadn't done laundry that day and give a quick ""I'm sorry, it's okay, I support you completely, I'll just...leave you to that"" and continue doing chores.

Dinner rolls around and he's refusing to make eye contact but eventually we ease into a conversation about how he's been hiding it for awhile, has a lot of homophobic friends and was ashamed to tell me because ""I'm your only son so you wouldn't have grandkids"". He planned to come out in college. I had no idea he thought I'd react that way and assured him I'd love him no matter what.

Apparently he's also not planning on...doing anything he'd need to practice with a spoon for in the near future...but was just curious and wanted to be ready. I'm relieved but mostly want to forget I ever saw that. At least it brought us closer.


TL;DR walked in on son gagging himself with a spoon. thought it was bulimia. turns out hes just gay.",cyneur,n/a,2019-09-02 10:45:26
"7 months pregnant, OB tells me I've gained too much weight. (Tw: eating disorders)","        Last week I had one of my regular ob checkups where they listen to your baby's heartbeat and ask you how you feel and if you have questions and all that. I told her I been doing great, no real issues. 
        She says my blood pressure looks great and then starts to kinda chuckle and says it's recommended that women in my bmi range should only gain 20-25 lbs and I have ""definitely reached that goal haha"". For reference when I wasn't pregnant I was 150-155lbs. 
        I told her I havent really changed my eating habits and I don't get weird cravings or anything. She told me ""I know being pregnant you can just smell food and gain weight but maybe instead of reaching for cakes and cookies you should reach for fruits and vegetables"". 
        At this point I'm starting to tear up a bit and I'm like.. trying to make my voice sound normal like there's isn't a lump in my throat. I forget what exactly I said next but it was something about how ive been going to the gym. She responds ""well it's not like the baby is 25lbs"". 
         I couldn't believe a medical professional would say this? Like ya a baby isn't 25lbs but what about hormonal weight gain? Amniotic fluid? The excess blood you get when you're pregnant? 
        This doctor is new to me because I had to move states (military), I had all my medical records sent over and I've done multiple screenings for everything since I arrived here. I made sure to let them know that I'm recovering (badly) from anorexia. I struggle so badly with body image issues. I cry on and off about being fat most days (even before this visit) and this doctor visit just crushed any confidence I had. 
        I dont eat cakes. I don't eat cookies. I snack on raw carrots, I choose sugar free, fat free, low fat, low carb, every diet food buzz phrase at the grocery store. I spend hours in the gym, I go on long hikes. When I was 90lbs I was too thin, I was just right at skinny fat 120, too big at 150, and too big when I'm growing a whole ass human inside me.

        Sorry if there's confusing wording, I got more upset as I wrote more. Don't really have any place to rant, my husband's gone 1/3rd of the time.



Edit: you guys got me sobbing. Your kind words are the warm hug I never knew I needed about this. Thank you for helping me feel less alone

I accidentally trained my cat to be an eating disorder support pet...,"I'm feeling guilty today. 

I've had this cat for 3 years now. My Ed got significantly worse about 2 1/2 years ago. 

At first, I didn't even realise what she was doing. I had a problem with purging for a long time... She would get between me and the toilet, demanding attention and fuss, while I cried. She would sniff my face and lick it, making it impossible to purge. If I locked her out of the bathroom, she would meow so loudly that I'm sure the neighbors heard. 

I finally managed to stop purging last year after recovering and relapsing a few times. The lockdowns have been really difficult, and not being able to go to the gym hasn't helped.

A couple of months ago, my cat stopped eating. She got so skinny, she was really underweight. Vets couldn't find anything wrong, I hadn't changed her food, there was no reason for it. 

I'm not sure how it happened... One day, I decided to have breakfast too. So I sat down with my food, and put her bowl next to me. And she finally **ATE**... I did the same at lunch time. And again, she actually ate. 

The same the next day. And the next.

We've been doing it for a while now. She's still underweight, but she's getting there. 

I wake up at 7am every day. We have breakfast at 9/9.30. I need those couple of hours to build up to breakfast. 

I slept really badly last night. I woke up at 9.10, and I just couldn't do it. Lunch is at 12, I just couldn't eat. 

I put Lily's food down by me. She stared at me. Stared at her bowl. Stared at me again. Then walked away. 

I'm heartbroken that I couldn't do it for her. She needed me to eat and I let her down...

She finally are at lunchtime. I had a sandwich. She kept glancing at me, pausing for me to continue before she would eat more.

People say we don't deserve animals.

I don't deserve this cat. She is saving my life, quite literally, and I don't think anyone appreciates or understands how incredible that is. 

It's also absolutely terrifying. **I** don't deserve this cat...

AITA for asking my sister to step down from being my bridesmaid because of her eating disorder/weight?,"I know it sounds bad when summed up that way, but I couldn’t think of a better/more descriptive title, so please hear me out before judging.

My (25F) sister Julia (28F) was overweight growing up while the rest of us (five girls, no brothers) were always petite. No one in our family ever treated her badly for her weight, though my mom did try to help her diet several times throughout our childhood for purely health reasons. She was hospitalized for her eating disorder for the first time when she was 18, and she’s been in and out of treatment facilities since then. She’s been “recovered” several times over the years, but it’s never been permanent. 

Pre-pandemic, Julia seemed to be on a recovery kick again. She looked healthy, seemed to be eating normally, and even asked if I wanted some of her old smaller clothes she was giving away (she has some nice stuff from when she was thinner—as I mentioned the rest of us are pretty petite). I was hopeful she could keep it together and felt okay about asking her to be a bridesmaid at that point.

That was the last time I saw her though (Feb. 2020), until I saw her Friday for Christmas. Julia has gained a LOT of weight in that time, probably 20 pounds, which is a lot because she’s short. This is a huge red flag to me because prior relapses have been preceded by weight gain, which seems to trigger another relapse.

So the way I see it, there are two possibilities from here. The first is that she relapses and loses all the weight, in which case she might not even show up for the wedding (she’s missed big family events because of being in residential treatment before), or maybe even worse she’ll continue to gain weight, in which case things like dress fittings could be a nightmare for her body image. In either scenario, I think it makes more sense for her to not be a bridesmaid. That way she can wear whatever she wants, be skinny or fat, show up or not, and it won’t affect the day as a whole.

So I texted her after Christmas to be ask if she was doing okay. Sure enough, she admitted she’d been having body image issues since gaining weight during lockdown. I kindly asked her to step down from being a bridesmaid, explaining that it was for her own good and I was only doing this because I cared about her. She seemed upset but agreed to step down.

Well, now our dad is furious with me, saying Julia is heartbroken. She of course hasn’t brought ANYTHING up to me directly (that’s how she always is). My mom and sisters are all on my side here and agree Julia not being a bridesmaid is what’s best for everyone. Julia has always been my dad’s favorite, so I wasn’t that worried about being in the wrong here—until my FIANCÉ said I was wrong and basically called me an AH for even bringing up her weight with her. Julia for her part now refuses to even engage the conversation and is upset with my dad of all people for talking to me about her “private” feelings. So I figured I’d ask here. AITA?

Edit: okay, I get it, I’m the asshole. And yes, of course protecting my wedding day is part of my consideration here. God forbid one single day doesn’t revolve around her I guess. And to those of you implying that my family caused her eating disorder, honestly screw you. This has negatively affected all of us in a ton of different ways. We never would have wanted this life for her or for any of us.

Edit #2: my fiancé was the one who suggested I post here in the first place to get an objective opinion, so he is reading these comments too. Please stop talking about our future children or saying he should leave me, because frankly you have no idea what you’re talking about; none of you know my life or my history. I‘ve had mental health struggles too—I’m lucky that they don’t involve body image because I have always been thin but they’ve still been immensely difficult to get through. I have BPD and anxiety through the roof. I didn’t have some perfect childhood where me and my sisters all ganged up on our one sister for being fat or whatever story some of you seem to have in your head. I will talk to Julia and try to be more understanding of her point of view, but none of you had to be there when even the mention of her having an issue with food caused a meltdown or when she’s ruined holidays because something as simple as someone gifting her an item of clothing caused her to break down in front of everyone.",kl5el7,n/a,2020-12-27 15:26:19

[my office does fat friday and i have an eating disorder](https://www.askamanager.org/2018/10/my-office-does-fat-friday-and-i-have-an-eating-disorder.html) (October 10th 2018)

Three months ago I started a new job and I really love it. My team is great, the people are lovely, and the work is exciting.

However, I’m struggling with a tradition known as Fat Friday. When I started it seemed to be once a month or so, but now it is every Friday — we’re all told to bring food in to share (and it is frowned on not to). There are themes, such as pastry week, meat feast, etc. The food is all laid out in the office, in the room we work in, and I’m not exaggerating when I say it is a staggering amount of food. It could feed us all twice over. And it is always high fat, high sugar.

Now, I completely understand that people love food and people bond over sharing food. But I am in recovery from an eating disorder that has followed me my whole adult life. I have very little willpower around food and I am terrified of gaining weight. I’ve had panic attacks in supermarkets because of it. The best way I can describe it is that I have an overwhelming, uncontrollable urge to eat, but I also fear gaining weight more than anything. I’ve had lots of therapy and I’m on medication that’s working well.

But Fat Friday is a minefield, with people pushing food on me and encouraging me to eat more. Last Friday, I ended up eating a lot and hating myself afterwards. Today, when I found out FF is now weekly, I almost cried in the office.

I would never want to take away other people’s fun. But am I just powerless here? Would it come across as fussy or overdramatic if I asked to work from home, or to sit in a different room? In my experience people don’t understand how severe my compulsion to binge eat is, and I’d hate to color my new manager’s opinion of me. But the thought of sitting for nine hours every Friday trying desperately not to eat is really worrying me.

[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/12/update-my-office-does-fat-friday-and-i-have-an-eating-disorder.html) (December 6th 2019)

I have to say that your advice was very helpful and it was also so reassuring to see people’s reaction to the idea of “Fat Friday.” I felt reassured that it wasn’t just me overreacting. Most of all, everyone was so supportive and thoughtful, thank you to all of you.

Following your response, I decided to talk to a senior member of my team, who was not my direct manager but did act as a sort of mentor figure to me. I confided that I found Fat Fridays difficult and distracting because I was in recovery from an eating disorder and she immediately agreed with me that the situation wasn’t ideal. She said she hated the constant smell of food lingering. We talked it through and she very kindly asked the Fat Friday organisers to make sure food was only put out in the kitchen, away from people’s desks – without mentioning my name. It helps that around the same time I started a new anti-depressant medication that really helps manage my anxiety and obsessive thoughts.

However, ultimately I did end up telling more people about my history with eating disorders after a colleague in a different department tried to sell me diet products! Think dodgy pyramid-scheme diet shakes that probably make you very ill. In the past, this kind of incident would have sent me into a real spiral and could have triggered a relapse, but I actually ended up laughing about it with my work friends and realising how far I’d come in my personal recovery. Sometimes it really is better to be open, rather than suffer in silence!

Thank you again for all your help and advice. It gave me the confidence to speak up.

AITA for having an eating disorder and not catering to everyone else's discomfort over it?,"I manage my illness the best I can, with the tools my many therapists have given me. So fyi, you can skip the ""you need to see a therapist"" comments, because I do. Seeing a therapist doesn't mean I'm automatically cured, ya know?

Anyway, about three weeks ago, me and my friends were at a park hanging out together catching up. Most of them were picnicking and sharing wine and all that jazz. I had one small glass of wine and prepackaged my food for the outing, as I literally always have done. (It was a chickpea, avocado, cilantro salad wrap)

Afterwards on the way home, people wanted to stop for ice cream. I stood to the side and let them do their thing, and just got a black coffee to enjoy while they ate. This caused more issues, where the same people were telling me to relax and just enjoy myself.

Then we came up to the subject of what our plans for the rest of the weekend were. I said I would be running and then catching up on some cleaning, and then meal prepping. One of them asked me if I ever just say ""fuck it"" and get a frozen pizza. I laughed and said nah, not my thing, but I was making some BBQ chicken & cauliflower rice with roasted brussels sprouts.

She was like BOOOORING and I finally got tired of the comments and said, ""Yeah, it might be boring, but I'm not willing to risk relapsing.""

She got really quiet and then as everyone was leaving, she was like, ""Hey, that was uncalled for. I was joking and you had to turn it into some big stupid thing about your eating disorder. Not cool. That stuff can be triggering for some people.""

I told her I didn't care if it wasn't ""cool"" but that I also wasn't going to take being needled at and prickled at all day because she's insecure, and that she spends her time bragging about binge eating pizza and laying in bed watching TV all weekend and *that* shit is triggering for *me* but I've never said shit about it.

She told me it wasn't the same, and that I was ""making her anxious"" and I said ""Hey, guess what, your comments about my food made me anxious as well. Except the difference is that I never comment on what you're eating, but you're always running your mouth about what I'm eating. Or not eating."" She fought back that it wasn't the same and that I was being a bitch, that I should know how my eating disorder might make others uncomfortable and I shouldn't rub it in everyone's face and just ""calm down and eat a fucking ice cream cone one in a while""

To which I told her, ""So you want me to eat one of my trigger foods just so *you* don't feel bad? You want me to end up with my face down a toilet throwing up everything I eat for the next two weeks just because you feel insecure?""

She told everyone that I made her feel bad about her weight (SHE'S! NOT! EVEN! FAT! She's SKINNIER THAN I AM, like not even a body dysmorphia thing she is literally 115lbs to my 130 and I'm shorter than she is!)

Anyway this is such stupid drama but I feel like she's being fucking ridiculous.

**ETA:** Jeez, I'm overwhelmed by the comments and for some reason, Reddit isn't letting me see them (it keeps redirecting me). Thanks, everyone. I am going to try to talk to my other friends about the situation and see if maybe we need to take some time apart. I hope not, but if that's what it takes, that's what it takes.

Drama in r/ArianaGrandeSnark after moderators ban discussion of Ariana’s “alleged” eating disorder,"r/ArianaGrandeSnark is a subreddit dedicated to criticizing or “snarking” on the singer/actress. Recent photos and videos of Ariana looking alarmingly thin have sparked much discussion about the singers’ health concerns, toxic beauty standards and normalization of eating disorders in Hollywood. 

Last night, the moderators made an announcement that they would no longer allow commentary on Ariana’s alleged’ eating disorder; adding this to the banned topics list, including speculation of drug use, pregnancy and abuse (namely by Dan Schneider, who Ariana worked with on “Victorious” as a teenager. Multiple actors and creative staff have claimed Schneider was abusive and fostered a toxic work environment in the “Quiet on Set” documentary). Users of the subreddit were not happy citing censorship of -in their opinion- an important discussion.

——

>hey everyone,
we just wanted to let you all know that moving forward, we will not be allowing any discussion or speculation about ariana’s alleged eating disorder or mental health conditions. this includes any comments or posts related to her body, mental and physical health, or eating habits.
here's why:
>1. respect for health privacy: while she is a public figure, ariana deserves the same level of privacy and respect regarding her health as anyone else. talking about her personal health in this way is invasive and unnecessary.
>2. toxicity: discussions like these often turn toxic, leading to excessive negativity and hate that doesn’t belong here.
>3. unverified info: there's no solid or credible confirmation regarding these claims. spreading rumors or assumptions doesn’t help anyone, especially our users who struggle with eating disorder and mental illness themselves. at the end of the day, we are not her doctors.
> we’d like to reiterate that we absolutely understand the genuine and good-faith concerns for ariana’s health. we hear you completely.
we want to keep the focus on snarking about her behavior and actions, not her body. there's plenty to discuss when it comes to her public persona without crossing into harmful territory. the mod team has seen and removed a large amount of outright horrible comments and while the comments are not directed us, they are starting to wear some of us down.

>I understand that we should respect their health privacy, but Ariana herself opened this up for public discussion when she made that video saying this is ""the healthiest she's ever been"" when she obviously looks unwell. She has a lot of impressionable young fans who look up to her, and some of them literally don't see a difference between her appearance now compared to a few years ago. They need to know that this physique is not normal, not healthy, and not something to aspire to be. In this age of Ozempic, with Hollywood celebrities and social media influencers losing weight and normalizing being underweight, we should have a space to call them out and be a voice of reason

This debacle prompted a user to create their own “second sub”, r/snarkingonariana which amassed nearly 500 members overnight. Users of the main sub also began questioning if the mod team had be “infiltrated” by fans, paid off by Ariana’s team or sent a cease and desist; this was refuted by a moderator’s new-deleted account.

Definitely a polarizing topic on the sub. What are your thoughts?",1iyxhcm,n/a,2025-02-26 20:32:37
"If you have a history with eating disorders, know this about ""I'm Glad My Mom Died""","Jennette (the author) writes heavily and graphically about her eating disorder history. She has struggled with all three of anorexia, binge eating, and bulimia, and she details her experience (including how she felt when doing it). Her book is great to spread awareness on what those with eating disorders go through, especially those who binge and purge, as she even writes about the toll it takes on her body. About her anorexia, she includes details about calorie intake and things like that. But of course, as with most good things, there are cons to it too. Although, if informed, a person who might get triggered could avoid the situation by not reading it. Someone actually wrote a post on r/bulimia to warn people that he relapsed from reading it. Another person commented that they too relapsed for the same reason. If the two of them did, I'm sure many many people around the world have. I don't know if the book has a trigger warning on it, but the audible version doesn't, and it really should.

Anyway, thought you should make an informed decision.

If you don't struggle with eating disorders and choose to read it, enjoy it! It's a great book, and really interesting to see her incredible transformation from Little Hurting Jennette into Adult Healthy Jennette.

Edit: I'm adding a paragraph, unedited, from a response I commented to someone below. I just felt like adding it because I feel it's appropriate to. (That last sentence sounded repetitive, but it's kind of not really lol.) Anyway, here it is, paragraph written by me:

>Yes, it's quite heartbreaking. My heart goes out to Little Jennette. I was going to add that into my last paragraph, but I was struggling with articulating it, and I know that saying that it's a great book is a compliment that an author would appreciate even if it's about their difficult life, so I decided to leave it at that.

Edit 2: How do you create a double line break between paragraphs on the app? I tried looking online, but I can't find a proper answer that's working for me.

Edit 3: Lol I just realized the first edit was actually unnecessary. I had forgotten that I actually didn't just leave it at ""it's a great book"" in the end in the first draft. But it doesn't hurt to leave the edit in, so...there it is. :)

Edit 4: Corrected the spelling of her name.

Edit 5: Oh my gosh upvotes in the THOUSANDS??? 🤯 Wow I had no clue this post would blow up! It's funny how the posts that blow up are always the ones we least expect to. Anyway, thank you everyone for your upvotes :) and your comments!

Edit 6: A big shout-out to u/hamwichsamwich for inspiring this post! I wouldn't have warned you all had it not been for his vulnerable post about his relapse in r/bulimia.",yls59n,n/a,2022-11-04 07:51:12
I think I am developing an eating disorder Update to: I checked my husband's reddit account and regretted it,"I don't really know how to start talking about this so please bare with me. I am currently a US Women's size 18. I have always been on the bigger side but never felt too insecure about it. Yes, I would have moments of insecurity but I wouldn't let it constantly live in my mind. Overall I tried to be body neutral. 

When my husband and I first started dating, he knew this was my biggest insecurity. I recently found out he fat shamed me on reddit (I posted that here before but then deleted it) The term blimp size was used. 

""Blimp sized"" keeps popping in my head. Whenever I look in the mirror or see my thighs expand when I sit down, it echos in my brain. I get uncomfortable enough that I needed a blanket over my legs when I am on the couch. I'm constantly inspecting my legs.I know I am big but I am 13 lbs lighter now than when we got married. 

Years ago, I used to do a 18:6  fast so I thought I would try it again. But now I am also watching my portions more. Before I was eating between 1200-1500 calories sa day. Now I am barely eating. I only eat inside of my time window. Logically, I know my body needs fuel and I should eat more. But I don't want to. I have no interest in food anymore and I used to love to cook. 

I haven't eaten anything all day and my feeding window just closed. Yes, my stomach rumbles sometimes. Now I am liking the feeling of my stomach being empty. I'm craving it. That scares me. But I don't know if I am being dramatic or not. My younger sister had an eating disorder and I know how bad that can get (she was hospitalized). 

I don't know what I am saying anymore. Am I being dramatic? ",1m9gtac,n/a,2025-07-26 01:27:39
AITA for eating a lot in front of my coworkers who are dieting? (Warning eating disorder discussion),"

I work in an office where most people eat at their desks because we're too busy to take long breaks. It's actually encouraged to eat meals at your desk

I struggled with disordered eating throughout a lot of my life and really the best way for me to keep healthy and not relapse is a couple rules for myself

1. Eat when I'm hungry instead of waiting for set meal times, to get in the habit of respecting my body's hunger cues
2. Eat what I want, no restrictive diets
3. Stop eating when I'm feeling my body's natural cues that I'm full
4. Don't talk about dieting or body sizes or shapes

It's honestly made me way healthier, I'm back closer to a healthy weight and getting used to understanding how to be in tune with what my body needs to be healthy and strong and nourished.

I also joke that I eat like a hobbit; Breakfast, Second Breakfast, Elevenses, Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner, Supper, Dessert... Turns out my body naturally gets hungry more often than 3 meals a day.

I work in an open office with coworkers who are on diets. I honestly try to tune out their diet talk because it's really reminiscent of some of my disordered habits. 

But I also eat frequently, And a couple of my coworkers started out by making comments about my ""young metabolism"" and how I eat constantly and am so skinny. I said I don't really like talking about weight or food with people so I'd rather if they didn't comment on my weight anymore 

But they kept making comments about how I'm ""eating again"" or how I stay so skinny. It's kinda hard to hear, because I'm trying to put on weight and me being as skinny as I am right now is still kinda dangerous for my health and isn't enviable

After a while I stopped feeling so patient, and just kept saying ""please stop talking about my weight"" or ""I don't want to talk about diets"" whenever they'd mention me eating all the time or being skinny

After I really started pushing back when they said that kinda stuff, about how I don't want to hear them talking about my body or my weight, they started complaining about me eating when they were trying to diet.

Saying ""can you not eat at your desk outside of lunchtime, I'm only eating a small salad a day and it's frustrating to see that"" and stuff like that. I said I don't want to talk about diets, it's just not a conversation I'm comfortable with. But I got hungry more often than once a day and so I'd try to pick foods that don't smell but I might eat more. 

Then two of my coworkers went to our boss to say that I wasn't focused at work because I was always having a meal at my desk. My boss didn't take that too seriously because he knows I get me work done but it's still stressing me out.

"Thanks, Karen, for re-igniting my eating disorder ","My first year of teaching there was a teacher appreciation week. Someone brought cupcakes so I had one during my “off” period in the teachers lounge. I never ate stuff like that, but my therapist was encouraging me to eat “off-limits foods” in my recovery from anorexia.

One of the receptionists came up to me to tell me that if she could go back, she never EVER would eat things like these cupcakes to maintain a slim figure “like yours.”

I literally was recovering from a decade long eating disorder which left me very unwell.  I had to quit my sport because I was so thin I was getting multiple stress fractures from a single season of collegiate running. I weighed barely 100 pounds at 5’10”. 

I looked her dead in the eye and said “well I can eat this because I used to be so skinny I couldn’t even walk, and I’m glad I’m finally eating enough food to try to not die.”

She just stared at me until I walked away.

"If you're a binge eater, continue binge eating instead of restricting. Game the system.","I know this sounds bad, but as someone who had a piss poor relationship with food all my life up until end of last year, I feel I am now confident enough to give this advice.

Every time I tried to ""diet"" or make a ""lifestyle change,"" people would tell me I would eat because I was bored or eat emotionally or that my hunger wasn't real. News flash - my hunger was very real. I was fat, and I had a lifestyle that stretched my stomach out, and my fullness signals were all out of whack (and let's not touch on my endocrine disorders). The only thing I had to gauge fullness off of was how full my stretched out stomach was. And I felt miserable. So I'd restrict, and I'd be miserable, and eventually, I'd cave and yo-yo.

This time around, you know what I did? I replaced stuffing myself with bad food with stuffing myself with better options.

Feeling hungry? Let me grab this here entire bag of salad. Yep, the entire thing. I'll add some dressing and a handful of croutons, and that's my snack. Six cups of the stuff, even with the worst dressing, was still under 200 calories. And you know what? I felt full.

I did this for weeks, not restricting how many salads I'd have (or occasionally, steamed veggies) or when, and slowly, I guess because of how much the salad compresses, my stomach began to shrink. I needed less and less of the salad to feel ""full."" 

And eventually, I stopped needing a salad an hour after dinner at all. Now, I eat about half the portions that I used to in order to feel full, and that has a tendency to match up exactly with my calorie goals for the day (1700). And I'm not miserable.

60lbs down, no perpetual hungry feeling, no general misery, and my back hurts less.

Don't let people convince you that your feelings or urges aren't real. Instead, find a way to game them until they slowly change for the better.

Edit: Some people are missing the point. ""Just work on better earing habits"" is peak unhelpful for people who don't have properly functioning hormone and signal sensitivity. What I'm saying is to try simple alternatives, because even ""slightly unhealthy"" options are still better than completely unhealthy ones. If you're able to feel full after eating a little bit of ""filling foods,"" then this post is not for you. Please stop trying to make us feel bad. All-or-nothing approaches do not work for most people.",u99469,n/a,2022-04-22 07:44:40
I can’t stop f****** binge eating,"I know it is a form of escape and comfort but i feel so unbelievably disgusted with myself for not being able to stop. My self worth is almost completely linked to how I look, I have only ever received any form of validation or “love” because I was attractive. I feel undeserving of love, especially if I don’t look a certain way. I’m in this vicious cycle of hating my body because I’ve gained weight then hating myself even more because I can’t stop binge eating. I don’t know how to stop, it’s how I’ve learned to comfort myself over years and it feels like a habit that’s impossible to break. I feel like I’ve made so much progress with healing but then I’ll binge almost every night. It makes me feel like I’ve gone nowhere. 

I’m sorry this is so chaotic and I hope it makes sense. Please let me know if you have any tips or just understand how I feel.",1apibd3,n/a,2024-02-13 02:26:36
Has anyone actually beaten binge eating?,"I have been binge eating for like 15 years and honestly I can’t take it anymore. I’ve tried every method I’ve come across including meditation, being kind to myself and forgiving the past, moderation, one day at a time, better than the day before and have dieted unsuccessfully for years because of it. 

I started therapy a year and a half ago and I just don’t feel it’s working for me I’ve had multiple therapists and nothing has changed at all. I’ve watched videos and podcasts about binge eating and discipline I’ve read countless books about habits and behaviour to try and figure it out. 

None of it works though the worse thing is I don’t even like the food I binge on usually I always regret eating it after and sometimes before it happens and yet it still happens. Sometimes I’ll even have an argument in my head about whether I should do it or not and very rarely I decide not to I think I’ve made some kind of progress and the next day I’ll binge again it’s miserable. I live in hope that one day something will just click and I’ll never binge again but it never happens.

Binge Eating Tips 101 from a Dietitian Who Used to Binge Eat,"Hi all

Hope you're well. I just wanted to raise awareness with how we can end binge eating and I understand the struggle as I have been binge eating during my time at university being so full that I couldn't even lie down asleep, have had fevers from feeling too hot from so much food ingested, and been brought down that 'You don't look like you struggle with food'.

And yes, I am qualified, I am a registered dietitian who supports people struggling with binge eating specifically and have my own youtube channel and stuff. But I'm not going to advertise out loud unless you ask me as helping is first priority

So first, need to first remember: **Binge eating is NOT the problem, it's a symptom of deprivation.** Binge eating means your body senses deprivation either physically (AKA hunger) or mentally (Aka no satisfation). It's a protective mechanism against starvation. You're not broken, your hunger cues are overregulated. 

Binge eating of course can come from trauma and emotional invalidation but that can be for another post. In this post I'll explain the diet to end binge urges because at the end of the day we head to the food which leads to the binge.

**Here are the main tips I would provide and I apologise if this isn't well ordered!**

1. **Eat regular meals -** Aim to eat breakfast, mid morning snack, lunch, mid afternoon snack, and dinner. Why? Because one massive binge trigger is physical hunger and you may think that you don't have hunger but I want you to review what you do after a binge? Do you promise yourself to be more strict, skip meals, or eat less the next day? Do you try to hold off this hunger to 'make-up' for your binge? Also, skipping meals or eating very little outside your binges is training your body to not be hungry outside binge times but when binge times come (often times for most people is evening), you get a MASSIVE surge in hunger out of nowhere! Ghrelin, the hunger hormone (Increases makes us feel hungry) is dictated by our pattern so we can change when we feel hungry. So after our binges, if we avoid trying to skip meals or eat very little, we are continuing this pattern of not feeling hungry and feeling a massive craving at night for most. Eating regular meals and snacks in between and aiming to stay roughly 7/10 full throughout the whole day will re-regulate our ghrelin release. With 0/10 being nauseously hungry and 10/10 being Christmas dinner full!
2. **Eat the foods you crave -** You might be thinking I'm crazy but 'you only binge on the foods you restrict'. When I say don't think of a pink elephant - you just thought of a pink elephant! But imagine you holding off a craving for a cookie, but the thought comes across your mind about it 100 times a day - and that's just 1 food. So eat the cookie and move on! Remember, if you're following number 1 by eating regular meals and staying roughly 7/10 full you will be satisfied with a portion - and sometimes you may have a little more than a portion and that is ok! Your body is honouring it's craving until it is satisfied. If you want me to back this up with a study you can simply check 'The Psychology of Food Cravings: The Role of Food Deprivation by Meule, 2020'

***Binge Restrict cycle:*** Binge>Feel guilt>Promise to diet as hard as possible to make up for the calories eaten the next day>Binge...

**3.** **Avoid the All-or-Nothing Mindset -** The longer we are in the binge-restrict cycle, the harder try to push ourselves out of it and demand faster and faster results but remember that the binge-restrict cycle is like quicksand - the more you struggle and work harder, the more you'll sink! So if you had a binge, don't think to yourself that you've ruined everything - try to use this opportunity to learn from it - 'What did I restrict' that led me to binge? 'What could I have changed' 'Maybe I binged but were the gaps in between binges getting longer? Am I having more days where I am not bingeing? - Because that is a sign of recovery'. Remember food is always there and it will be there tomorrow and that you are always moving the right direction if you avoid feeling guilty after a binge and keep trying to give yourself more and more freedom

**4.** **Ensure your meals are balanced -** During recovery, to ensure fullness AND satisfaction together with your regular eating throughout the day in #1, **make sure your meals contain carbohydrates, fats, protein, and fibre**. Having all 4 can ensure that your meals are filling and delicious. For example if you feel like you want toast and butter for breakfast, aim to add a protein source to it like maybe cottage cheese. If you binged last night, but still want something for breakfast and have a piece a plain bagel with nothing on it, and you know you are avoiding the butter because you don't want to 'gain' weight, then that is a form of mental restriction and not honouring your cravings.

**5. Reintroduce fear foods gradually into your diet -** Make a list of 3 columns: Least feared, average feared, and most feared foods and fill them up. Contrary to popular belief, introducing the least scary will only cause more anxiety the more you go up the ladder, start with the MOST feared food but the trick is to add it after a main meal which contains protein, fats, carbs, and fibre and be 7 out of 10 full and that the meal is actually delicious so you're FULL and Satisfied then you're at the 'safest' place to introduce this fear food as a dessert.

Think of it like when you get bitten by a labrador, you start to associate this fear with all labradors, then it moves on to avoiding all dogs by fear association - but these are only assumptions. Exposure therapy is about exposing yourself at the safest situation so when you do expose yourself, you're only confirming that this not as scary. We're turning assumptions into facts. This turns fear foods into neutral foods.

**6. Eating because you are bored? -** Aim to build a routine in the evening as boredom can increase the risk of binge eating and a routine may be protective. So you may try going to the gym, go out for a walk, find a colouring book, anything to 'distract you'. If you are struggling with sleep, improving your sleep hygeine such as avoiding night time blue light in phones or laptops may be helpful, reducing or stopping caffeine, maybe taking a magnesium supplement at night may help.

***What to Expect***

You cannot be in binge-eating recovery and expect to lose weight. In fact the NICE (National institute of Care and Excellence) report that during binge eating recovery, ***weight loss is not the focus.***

People struggling with binge eating disorder often maintain their weight and during treatment also maintain their weight or gain a slight amount of weight. The key is to establish regular eating patterns.

It is not easy and to be honest, there will very likely be slip-ups and binges but **the key that will help you move forward is self-compassion.** If you recognise that you are not binging, it is the eating disorder bingeing, then you will gain more self-compassion for yourself because it is not your fault.

Recovery may take weeks or even months depending on how long and how much the binge eating has had control over your life but now is the time for you to take control! If anyone ever shames you for finding food freedom, remember that their comments is a reflection of their insecurities around food and a reflection of their relationship around food NOT yours <3

Hope that helps and let me know if you have any questions!!

[Conversation] I overcame serious binge eating disorder. Ask me anything.,"I’ve been wanting to make this post for a while, so I’ll try my hand at it (again).  This is the story of how I stopped binge eating, and I’m sharing with you because it might help.  My disclaimer is that *everyone is different*, and what worked for me might not work for you.  This post might also trigger your eating disorder.

________________________

My binge eating began after a brief stint with anorexia two years ago.  When I started eating again, I also started counting calories—something I’d never before done.  I joined MyFitnessPal and it told me to eat 1200 a day, so I did.


I made it maybe a few months, if I’m being generous, before the binges started.  I was very active—did Crossfit a few times a week, bicycle-commuted to work, hiked every weekend—and I felt like I was starving to death on 1200 calories.  Some days I would get to 3:00pm and only have 200 calories left, which I knew wasn’t going to accommodate a filling dinner or that croissant I was craving.  I tried my best to fill up on a full plate of broccoli, but it just didn’t cut it, and I’d eventually cave and eat the croissant.  Then I’d feel so guilty that I would eat the whole bag of croissants.  


Other days I’d eat something “bad,” like a cookie at work, and then feel so bad about myself—so fat and out of control—that I would eat an entire box of cookies when I got home.  Or I would plan to eat something bad, schedule my entire day around a chocolate bar, and then the obsessive thoughts would drive me into another binge.


My binge eating was a full-blown compulsive food addiction.  I did not eat things because they tasted good; in fact, most of my binges were on things I didn’t even like that much, or crazy things.  Despite disliking muffins, I would buy and binge eat an entire packet of them every Wednesday.  One time I ate an entire *pound* of raisins, washed down with three bagels.  I was sick for a week.  If there was no food in the house, I’d binge eat raw sugar.  These weren't isolated incidents--I ate this way almost every night.  Sixteen boxes of macaroni and cheese, 10 bags of popcorn, a sleeve of bagels.  


I gained around 30 lbs in a few months—from 105 lbs to 135 lbs.  None of my clothes fit.  Whereas before people might comment on my lunch salad and tell me, “You don’t need to eat salad!” now they were saying, “Did you weigh the dressing?  Those calories can really sneak up on you.”  I was ashamed to see old friends.  It felt like I was wearing my mental problems very publicly on my body.


I tried for about a year to control it by fasting, or willpower, or going to the gym three times a day (all of which made it worse).  But after a certain point, I just wanted to stop.  I no longer cared if I was pudgy or skinny or needed new jeans; I just wanted to eat normally.  

I was at my parents’ house one day when I saw the book “Intuitive Eating” on my mom’s bookshelf.  That book saved me.  You can find the [10 basic principles on their website](http://www.intuitiveeating.com/content/10-principles-intuitive-eating), but I highly recommend reading the book itself.

The first thing that I implemented was: no restrictions.  If I wanted to eat it, I ate it.  And I ate as much as I wanted of it.  And I enjoyed it the entire time.  This turned out to be huge amounts of trail mix.  Even though I was still eating way more than I needed, the simple act of allowing myself to eat it instantly started to turn things around.

After that, I started to identify the things that made me binge eat.  I can no longer remember the name of all the inner thoughts that “Intuitive Eating” names, but they talk about things like the “food police.”  The food police thoughts try to tell you that what you’re eating is bad, and not allowed.  However, when you don’t honor your hunger and eat the things that you want to eat, your body panics.  It wants bread, goddamnit, and all that lettuce isn’t bread.  It might be nutritious, but it’s not filling.

There is a process that goes on when you start intuitively eating.  You must trust that your body knows how to eat, and your body will regulate itself once you fix your obsessive thinking.  Maybe you eat a bag of candy today, but your body will balance it out by craving lettuce next week.  Maybe you eat a lot over the holidays, and when you get back to your routine, you just want some light soup.  The key is that you don’t force yourself to eat soup, or skip a meal, or eat lettuce.  You just eat whatever you want, whenever you want, and your body will make the right choices.

Mealtimes:  When I was binge eating, I only let myself eat at very specific times, because I felt like I could control the binges if I could make sure that I was on this schedule.  No more.  If I feel like lunch at 11:00am, I eat lunch at 11:00am.  If I feel like dinner at 3:00, I eat dinner at 3:00.  

Candy and other “bad” foods:  No foods are bad.  While you eat that bag of Twix bars (which I did, two weeks ago), you enjoy every last one.  There is no wrong amount of candy to eat.

Exercise:  When I was binge eating I lifted weights because I thought it was the best way to lose weight.  Unlike a lot of you ladies, I hated lifting.  I hated the gym, hated everything about it.  After I started recovering, I went back to my favorite exercises: running and yoga.  I don't run because I have to run to keep my body, or because I'm unhealthy and I need to get healthy, I run because I love running.  I do yoga because I love yoga.  Binge exercising is about as sustainable as binge eating; in the end, you have to build a lifestyle that will serve you, not a crash diet.

It’s taken me about a year and a half to get to this point, where I’m writing this post and it doesn’t trigger me at all.  It was difficult at times for me to trust the program, because I just wanted to be skinny.  But I knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that crash dieting wasn’t sustainable or going to work for me.  1.5 years later, I’ve lost 30 lbs.  

Last night I went to a restaurant and left half of my meal on my plate because I just wasn’t hungry anymore.  Two weeks ago, I ate an entire bag of candy over the span of two days.  I weigh 105 lbs again without weighing my dressing, counting calories, or restricting myself in any way.   ",2mo8dr,n/a,2014-11-18 15:52:47
"I've removed bad things (smoking/vaping, alcohol, porn, binge eating) and now don't know what else to do outside of work and gym. Same day every day.","I try to be grateful of the little things try new things. Smell the flowers, get some sun, try a new cafe or cook something new. Idk wtf else to do. I swear the last year I've done absolutely nothing but just exist and go to work while staying really fit and healthy. I don't crave alcohol anymore or vaping or porn watching or eating biscuits watching mindless crap online to 'pass time'.

But now I just feel like a complete empty boring loser. I don't know what this means now. I just exist and do the 'right' things and nobody is around in any capacity to say hey well done I'm proud of you keep going etc.

Like, I'm single as f and have no friends. Just sometimes wonder who I'm doing any of this for anyway. Can't wait to retire and then what, sit around feeling comfortable and just die in my sleep.

I feel like my life is a piece of plain white bread. And it's stale.

I work with my coworkers but don't like them. I've tried group meetups, but it was awkward as shit and full of guys. Taken the long way to work or a different way home. Listen to upbeat music in my car and at home. Sleep heaps. Eat super well. Saving money you know all that shit. But that's it. I just don't know what else.



I've read travel as a suggestion innumerable time. I'm legitimately not interested in it. I'm a homebody and that's fine with me.

Roommate won’t stop binge eating my food…,"I (30F) am temporarily renting out half of a 2bed 2.5bath condo for a 3 month contract. I live with the owner (47F). When I moved in she told me she had lost 100lbs a year or two ago without working out. I have since come to learn she has a ‘health coaching business’…. aka she is in an MLM. She only eats powdered supplements all day and has one keto meal at night. I looked into her ‘company’, it is essentially a starvation diet and the supplements are quite expensive.

None of this is a problem for me, live and let live as long as you don’t try to recruit me to the scam. The issue comes in, at least once a week she binge eats huge quantities of my food. It’s high fat, keto type foods - entire jars of almond butter, bags of shredded cheese, 1lb bags of pecans or cashews, and recently 6oz cans of fried onions. She eats these in one sitting, usually if I am away for a weekend.

She is always very apologetic, embarrassed, and immediately runs out to replace what she has eaten. I feel bad, I definitely had some periods of binge eating in my 20s, but never to the point eating someone else’s food. One time I said I was going to an event but ended up cancelling. When I came out of my room and walked into the kitchen she looked like she had seen a ghost. There was my empty bag of 8 cheese slices and her hand was in my almost finished costco bad of nuts. It is very awkward!

I have never had this issue before. I think she has some other mental health struggles and I do not want to rock the boat. Plus she does replace everything, although a few times I have had to ask her to. I’m moving out in a week or so. Should I leave this in my review of the place?

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: I am glad she replaces your food but that would be so annoying to live with.

>**OOP:** Yes sometimes I go to use things I use sparingly (butter, avocado oil) and they are gone.

Commenter: She a drank a bottle of avocado oil true or false

>**OOP:** Ha!!! No it was a spray. She had already used a full bottle, replaced that, then used that one up entirely without replacing.

Commenter: That person is destroying their liver/kidneys, between the high fat/protein binge and the powdered supplements. They'll probably wind up admitted with AKI and get yelled at by their physician.

>**OOP:** Oh absolutely. She asked me if she might have anemia because she’s so tired. I pointed out she doesn’t eat any carbohydrates and that is definitely effecting her energy levels. She said her supplements provide ‘all the nutrients that fruits and carbs have so it can’t be that’…  
>  
>I’d also be concerned for lack of fiber. I recently have been seeing that colon cancer is on the rise because diets are more processed/lack fiber from fresh produce.

Commenter: Yeah, you should. I wouldn't want to live with someone like that who hasn't taken any steps to rectify it (it's good that she replaces the food right away, but still unacceptable that she's still eating all of it in the first place).

>**OOP:** True, she has gone in my cabinets to take things out and tries to put them back exactly where they were, but I still notice. For example I always use a fork when prepping my overnight oats (feels a little easier than a spoon, maybe just a weird habit of mine), and use that fork to dig out my almond butter. A few times I’ve opened the jar and there are spoon marks, with quite a bit missing. This is also disgusting if she ate straight from the jar, which knowing her hygiene habits would not suprise me.

Commenter: This was me in my teens-20’s. I was “fit”, but my binge-restrict cycles were out of control. I was basically low grade starving myself all day and the urge to eat large quantities of high-fat, high-carb food at night was uncontrollable. Especially peanut butter. Sometimes I would do it while half-asleep. My binges would spill over into my roommates food sometimes and I would feel really bad and replace it. I’m so glad that’s all in the rear view mirror.

>**OOP:** Sounds like you are in the same spot as my roommate. Do you have any ideas on how I can compassionately approach her and tell her I think she needs some help? What would have been helpful to you during that time?

(The above commenter's response) Honestly I was so consumed by guilt and shame and uncontrollable urges, I don’t know what I would’ve needed to hear at that time. I definitely knew I had a problem. Maybe gently start with the fact that you had an eating disorder too and you know how it feels, and that you knew someone (me!) who dealt with the same thing and treatment changed their life. Granted, I’m not as small as I used to be but neither am I out of control with my weight and food. If she’s ready to embrace sanity around food over thinness, then she’ll be receptive. But I was deathly afraid of weight gain at the time so any solution that would cause my artificially low weight to stabilize upwards would’ve been met with a panic attack and extreme rejection.

But just showing empathy is a big first step. When I lived at home for a year (for ED treatment) I asked my parents to put a lock on the pantry door so I wouldn’t night eat, and that also helped. It sounds like it’s too late for you to do that - also an unfair burden on you - but just a thought. I wish I had a better answer for you, but it sounds like she needs to hit rock bottom and have a come to Jesus moment where she realizes a normal life is more important than desperately trying to lose weight in an unhealthy way.

>**OOP:** Well said, thank you for this incredibly thought out response. I think I will have a conversation with her and say I feel for her that she seems to lose control around food. I’ve had those feelings myself. But also make it clear that it bothers me. Maybe that soft boundary will be enough to push her in the right direction? I’m glad you got help!! Thank you again

*To a deleted comment:*

>She replaces stuff but then helps herself to the replacement! Her hygiene habits are…. lax…. so it really grosses me out if she is eating my shredded cheese straight out of the bag or almond butter with a spoon straight from the jar.

Commenter: Instead of replacing your food why doesn’t she just go get her own?

>**OOP:** I have no idea. Someone else commented it can be a psychological thing - if I don’t buy the ‘bad food’ myself then I won’t eat it - but then they feel out of control and see what’s sitting right there and go crazy.

Commenter: Your review of the place? Like you are going to proactively seek out a review site and post about this woman’s struggles like that, just cause? I dunno… Why?

>**OOP:** I am renting the place through a website similar to airbnb. I have used it 5 other times and you are strongly encouraged to leave reviews.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1c09ma9/update_roommate_wont_stop_binge_eating_my_food/)**: April 9, 2024 (Next Day)**

The day after I originally posted I noticed my 16oz sour cream was mostly gone and had spoon marks. I had used a fork to drizzle a small amount over nachos last time I used it, so safe to assume my roommate had eaten it. Our schedules don't always line up so I decided it would be best if I talk to her via text when she is off work. Convo went as follows:

me: hey when I was home earlier I noticed a pretty significant portion of my sour cream was gone

rm: At the store now. Was doing some work until 3am and had a low moment. I’m really sorry. Replaced by 5:15pm.

me: It’s okay you don’t need to replace. I did want to talk about it though, it bothers me when my food is missing. can you please try to avoid touching my stuff in the fridge or my cabinet?

rm: Yes.

me: I understand what it’s like to be out of control sometimes when it comes to food 🫶🏻 let me know if you ever want to talk. is there anything I can do to help make it easier to avoid?

rm: Not a good housemate trait. It’s disrespectful of your stuff and I’m sorry. I’ve been struggling lately. Thanks for bringing it up. I know I need to change

me: it is not a character flaw! life is tough enough as it is. I’ve been there before. please do not beat yourself up about it ❤️

rm: Thanks. Well, do you need anything at the grocery store while I’m here?

me: nah i’m all set thank you!

When I got home she had bought an identical new sour cream and got me flowers, has been up in her room all evening though :( A very nice gesture, I really did not need any more sour cream and was not going to come close to finishing it in the next week before I move out.

While she often takes small portions of certain things I probably wouldn't have used/noticed anyway, I mentioned in a few comments on the original post - I have other concerns of her hygiene and food safety habits. She is frankly a pretty messy/disorganized/forgetful person and frequently leaves the kitchen and living room (common areas) a mess with used dishware, crumbs/pieces of food on the couch, remnants all over the stove, dirty dishes in the sink for days, etc. I have also witnessed her several times leave meat/dairy out unrefrigerated for hours and then eat it. I do not want ANY person to eat straight out of my jar almond butter/sour cream with a spoon, or out of a bag of my shredded cheese with unwashed hands - even if it is a tiny bit. I have always been very aware and intentional of my food safety.

Thank you to everyone who shared their personal ED struggles. As mentioned I have definitely had my own journey toward a healthy relationship with food. After posting, I realized this situation may be particularly triggering to me as I believe my dad has a long history of what I think is binge-eating tendencies. As many suggested, I set a boundary with my roommate but also tried to be compassionate.

To those saying I should tear her down from being in an MLM - I don't think this would be productive in any way. Don't get me wrong I have consumed a lot of anti-MLM content and agree they are pretty universally bad. Yet I know those involved in these scammy companies sometimes view naysayers as fuel to strengthen their bond with their 'team'. I'm not touching on this with her.

Some recommended buying a mini fridge or a fridge lock box. I won't personally be doing this for my case but both good ideas. I didn't know they made fridge lockboxes, including this in the event it is helpful to anyone reading this in a similar scenario.

As far as leaving a review - I'm still torn on what to do. I rented this place through a service similar to Airbnb in which you are strongly encouraged to leave reviews. I've used it 5 times before and honestly have never had to give less than 5/5 stars. The food is a problem but also she is very messy and often dirty as well. As someone who is super neat/organized and cannot sleep if there are dishes in the sink and counters aren't wiped down - I would really struggle to give even 4/5 stars. I am not sure if I can in good faith give a highly positive review. I am considering leaving no review, but in the event I do [u/fourpuns](https://www.reddit.com/user/fourpuns/) gave me a good idea. To include the line ""occasionally ate food I had purchased but always replaced it."" Short, sweet, truthful, not malicious. I would never ever go into detail or 'out her'.

To those saying I should poison her with hot sauce, laxatives, cayenne, etc.... BE F'IN FOR REAL. That is illegal and dangerous to both of us. This is a PERSON that is struggling. You don't kick someone while they are down. Despite us not being a great match roommate-wise, she is a warm and kind person that has tried her best to make me feel welcomed in many other ways. I truly wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward.

I am moving out in a week since my contract is ending, so I have a feeling there will not be any more food problems. This has been an eye-opening experience. I hope I handled as kindly as I possibly could have while respecting my own needs. If all else fails, I like to reframe uncomfortable/difficult scenarios as something one can use in job interviews to answer 'tell me about time you faced a problem and how you fixed it.' 🤷‍♀️

Would love to hear from survivors, dietitians, or counselors in the ED sphere for ideas on how to help an acquaintance who is struggling with their relationship with food. Open to constructive criticism for any tips on how I could have used better language in our convo. For myself and others as a reference.

Thank you all!!

I’m not sure if she’s eaten anyone else’s food before. She didn’t eat anything of mine for the first month or 6 weeks I lived here. I needed to say something because it was bothering me.

**Mini Update Next Day in Comments:**

I just know she was so upset last night and hiding away I feel so bad about that! But thankfully she’s up and at it and more chipper today :)",1cpz7de,n/a,2024-05-12 04:01:58
I wanted to share a trick I used to curb my binge eating and maybe it'll help you too if you're struggling,"Hear me out, it might sound silly, but chopsticks. Pour your snacks into a bowl and eat your snacks with chopsticks, one at a time. A bowl of snacks that would last me a few minutes by grabbing more than one thing at a time can now last me half an hour maybe? This really helped me when I would snack while playing video games. Between games, or even during, I'd snack a ton but now, I can't use my chopsticks while I play and between games, I can only eat so many by using my chopsticks. I have decreased my intake by only needing 1 bowl of my preferred snack and it takes me longer to eat, giving me more time to digest and feel the effects of being satisfied by the snack, rather than just eating and eating.

A side effect of this trick is that you will become super good with chopsticks. Hope this can maybe helps some people as it has for me!

"LPT: If you are used to binge eating or consuming large meals, separate the portion you ideally need to be eating, finish it and take a 5 min break.",9/10 times this works for me because my body realizes it doesnt need more food and stops the craving.,11i8714,n/a,2023-03-04 17:51:48
what are your binge eating rock bottoms,"this is for purely selfish reasons to hate myself a bit less, since i'm currently crouched in my backyard in the pitch black and freezing cold so my parents don't hear, shoveling down spoonfuls of straight sugar and cereal crumbs like it's cocaine. i'll be surprised if my stomach doesn't implode in the next few hours. 

  
also i feel like people only talk about the negatives of restriction when it comes to EDs, and not how painful and taxing being a binge eater is, and i need to feel a little bit less insane.",1kshwpp,n/a,2025-05-22 04:17:59
Working out and eating right feels good. Binge eating and skipping the gym does not. Don't let your lizard brain trick you into getting it backwards.,"Just got back into the gym after a 2 week spell of skipping for no real reason. Sipping my protein shake and realizing how good it feels, physically, mentally, and emotionally, to take concrete steps towards changing my body and lifestyle. However, this is a cycle: workout for a few days, feel great, ""deserve a cheat / rest day"", spiral out and binge eat / skip workouts for a few days, rinse and repeat. Something about the human brain hates change. The brain hates calorie counting, restriction, being told ""No!"". Sometimes its helpful to remind ourselves that working out and eating right isn't punishment for being fat. Working out and eating right is just self-care. Its the same as getting a good night's rest or taking a shower. No real purpose to this post other than to get some thoughts and emotions on paper (or keyboard). Feeling hopeful right now. :) 

edit: I can't reply to each comment, but the response to this post has been incredible. To all of those who have said this post helped them to get back in the gym or avoid an unnecessary binge, I am profoundly happy to know that my post had a positive effect on you. Keep grinding, we're all going to make it. :) ",ax9ymt,n/a,2019-03-04 17:47:12
I had an emotional binge eating episode and my husband's reaction made me cry,"Obligatory mobile user apologies. I've struggled with my weight for my whole life (27F) coming from a family where health and exercise wasn't considered a necessity and my mom made consistently poor quality meals. I'm married now, two kids of my own and I'm very good about healthy eating, and we even grow some of our own foods in our organic garden, so I've been able to manage my weight quite well in my twenties. It's been a stressful week and last night I stayed up too late watching Letterkenny and straight plowing my way through some leftover Easter candy. I was absolutely ham, I was just so distraught and upset and basically, I felt better afterwards, even though it was a bad thing to do. Then I fell asleep and forgot about it. Cue this morning, I'm getting dressed and notice the candy wrapper pile I'd accumulated last night is gone. My husband notices this and cheerfully says he cleaned it up already, and that he was jealous, I should have invited him to my late night candy party! Honestly I was just wanting to burst into tears. How wonderful to hear something like that when all I had for myself were condescending thoughts, hurt feelings and angry judgement for myself. It was so sweet, the gesture and the statement. He loves me even when I'm a wreck. I really feel like i don't deserve him sometimes.",gbjvme,n/a,2020-05-01 15:11:41
Do you struggle with binge eating?,"Sometimes when I’m home avoiding my avoidable tasks as usual I start “getting hungry” too many times along the day, consciously unconscious (if that’s a thing) like feeling guilty but ignoring it and eating anyway and by the end of the day I’m very full and feeling very guilty. Have you dealt with this? What do you do when that happens?",ognru5,n/a,2021-07-09 04:07:08
Would you say something to another mom if her kid binge-eating sweets during playdates?,"My 9-year-old has a friend who comes over every so often and has an issue with binge eating sugary, processed food. 

She never asks, but instead sneaks off and eats a lot. Yesterday, while the other girls were outside playing, she kept going back into my daughter’s room to eat her school Easter candy and claw machine prizes. She also told the other girls to distract me so she could raid the pantry. She ended up eating the equivalent of an entire bag of candy out of the claw machine, plus a bunch of pantry snacks—including six Jello cups she stuffed into her pockets, 6 individually wrapped chocolate cookies, half a box of gummy worms, and panda cookies that go in my daughter's lunches. All in all, she probably ate around 3,000 calories of sugary treats. My daughter didn't tell me what she was up to until afterwards and was somewhat upset about it. 

This isn’t a one-time thing. Something has happened on every visit. On a birthday trip we took together once, she licked dropped cake off the hotel carpet.

I’m not trying to shame anyone—I remember being a kid and going overboard with sugar too—but I can’t help wondering if something else is going on. We’re not close with her mom, so I feel weird and a little embarrassed bringing it up. I also worry that it might come off as judgmental.

Would you say something? Or just quietly manage the situation when she visits? I think next time I'm going to have to put all prepackaged sweets in my room so I can lock the door. I offered the kids snacks - blueberry muffins, pretzels, fresh fruit, and cheese which she didn't touch. Plus she had just had a full lunch right before she arrived. This is only an issue with processed foods. ",1jzclht,n/a,2025-04-14 22:59:15
The answer on how to ACTUALLY stop binge eating - Ride the Craving Wave!,"Two years ago, I attended a 6-week workshop called ""Craving Change"" to help overcome overeating. I learned a lot. The first two weeks were about taking note of emotions before, during and after eating. Interestingly, like addicts with drugs, the brain lights up most in the moments immediately BEFORE we consume. It's not about the actual eating/food. We also worked through what triggers the overeating - a time, place, person, feeling, etc. We identified if hunger was really ""stomach hunger"" (physical hunger) or if it was ""mouth"" (all about the taste/texture) or ""heart hunger"" (filling a need that has nothing to do with hunger, often emotional, but also could be a habit or wanting to please others, etc.) 

I used to have very problematic eating in the evenings and could easily munch on 1000s of calories to the point where I felt absolutely stuffed/sick. I have shared this method often in the comments and it always gets a lot of positive feedback, so I thought it deserved its own post. I will probably also keep commenting about it when people ask, so sorry if you've read this before!

My workshop had a repertoire of skills to try out and choose from to help stop problematic eating behaviours. The one that worked the best for me was to **visualize an ocean wave and ""ride the craving wave.**"" Like a wave on an ocean, a craving slowly builds up. It then becomes very big, powerful, overwhelming. But then with time, it crests, falls, and the ocean returns to calm. You can imagine your craving like a wave. It will pass with time. 

Day 1, **wait 30 seconds** before giving into the craving. Then **give yourself permission to eat** whatever you are craving with **no judgement**. The next time, add 30 seconds to your wait time. Keep incrementally adding time each time you feel a craving. Eventually you will wait 5 minutes, 10 minutes... Research shows that **a craving can pass after 15-20 minutes**, so you may not even want the thing anymore! During your wait time, actually picture the ocean wave in your mind, picture it as it gets stronger, and visualize the moment when it will return to calm.

While I am riding out the wave, I also like to repeat to myself my favourite mantras and quotes. What is your favourite motivational quote/mantras?

*The time is going to pass anyway, you might as well spend it working towards your goals.*

*You will never always be motivated, so you must learn to always be disciplined.*

*There is no one big step that does it. It is a lot of little steps.*

I pair all this with even more strategies: have a big glass of water, tea, or flavored seltzer water while you are waiting. Remove yourself from the place (go for a walk, get off the couch and tidy up, etc.) Call a friend. Work on hobby (something that involves hands is best.) Brush your teeth. Journal.

**The biggest first step is to PAUSE before eating**. Take note of why you are eating, either mentally or actually writing it down. Then choose to eat if you want, but now at least you know why you are doing it. Eventually, with practice, I am able to keep my goals in mind and have those be stronger than any cravings. Now that even more time has passed where eating in the evenings isn't a thing for me anymore, the cravings often don't come at all. I have a much healthier relationship with food.

The hardest part about weightloss is not diet or exercise - it's PATIENCE. It takes a long time. I constantly remind myself that we are in this for the long haul. We are in this for life! If I have a bad day, I log it and move on - the most important thing is getting right back to it the next day. It's about sticking with it. *Dedication and persistance will pay off over time.* 

Good luck everyone. Try this out and remember to be patient with yourself. It really works!",pm6v5t,n/a,2021-09-11 12:50:49
Anyone else been binge eating since childhood?,"No shade to my young adult starvation -> binge eating people but I cannot relate. I've been binge eating since I was in elementary school.

Mounjaro and binge eating,"So I have a history of binge eating. I know people have said mounjaro is amazing for stopping food noise which I hope will work for me .

Helpful trick with binge eating at night,"This has helped me immensely so I thought I would share in case it can help others. My husband and I have a toddler and our days are pretty stressful/exhausting. Pair that with sleep regressions and frequent colds (thanks daycare) and you have two adults that enjoy unwinding in front of the television with some snacks. 

Well my snacking has been out of control lately and I started to associate the couch with eating. Even if I was full, I would find myself in the pantry as soon as I realized I was empty handed on the couch. 

A few days ago I picked up some non-caffeinated tea at the grocery store. I decided to make a cup at night while watching one of our shows. Fast forward to today and I have completely replaced my snacking habit with tea! It fills my empty hands and gives me something to look forward to at night. Plus I have fun picking out different flavors at the store (pomegranate white tea is my current fav) and feel like I’m giving my body something good for it. I guess the old wisdom of replacing a bad habit with a good one worked! Hope this helps someone!",o6kh4z,n/a,2021-06-23 19:49:11

How on Earth do you stop binge eating for comfort when you are depressed?,"Honestly? I have been depressed for my whole life and spent years eating for comfort to help myself feel better. I know that’s why I am fat, want to lose weight badly and just can’t seem to stop.

"I don't like people telling me ""It's okay to have one cheat day"" and trying to pressure me into binge eating.","I can not eat like you do, I have an unhealthy relationship with food. You wouldn't take a recovering alcoholic out to drink, and then tell them ""one night out with the boys isn't gonna hurt"" so please don't say it to me either

Going out to binge eat with your friends might be a great time for a lot of people, but for me binge eating is tied to a very dark time in my life. I was 400 lbs, ate 4000-5000 calories a day, I hated myself and wanted to stop, but I couldn't. When I ate I could turn my brain off for a bit and ignore how terrible everything was around me, and I did that as much as I could. It took a lot of work, but after all that effort I was able to give up that coping mechanism.

I still enjoy eating, and I still have a bit of that escapism from it, but it is all under strict control. I log stuff before I eat it, and if I can't log it accurately, I don't have it. I do not have any cheat days, I have not had a cheat day in two years.

Yes, it is strict, but I do not want to change it. I am much happier now without that short term contentment of binge eating. Trust me, I am not depriving myself of joy by declining food, if you feel like you are excluding me because I am not eating anything then the solution is to pick places to hang out that don't center on food, not to try and pressure me into binge eating.",u01ipn,n/a,2022-04-09 20:25:49
Went to a binge eating specialist. Wow that was disappointing. I found out a hard truth.,"I'm 5'11 and 240 pounds. I classify as obese. 

I've been overweight the majority of my whole life and have had struggles with binge eating for the past 4-5 years. I still go to the gym 5 times a week and run 4 miles 4 times a week. 

We talk about why I had urges, how to prevent them aka eating at different times, making sure I eat 3 meals a day, etc. The stuff I basically already have heard before. 

We later on talk about how there's ""health at every size"" and how you can still be overweight and healthy, perhaps even obese. **Now, I'm not completely against the idea. I'm not saying that this is false. Let me make that ABUNDANTLY clear.** However, there are many problems with being overweight and obese that go even beyond the superficial if you are in that unhealthy spectrum. 

Joint issues, heart issues, sleep issues, etc. 

She was also  against calorie and macro tracking. Which was also a huge red flag. I do understand that some people are against it and are big on intuitive eating. That's simply not me and never will be. I respect the science of calories in and calories out, because well...it works. 

So overall, you have to lose weight the way YOU want to. Professionals don't always have the best advice for you specifically. If you're comfortable with intuitive eating, go for it. If you count calories and macros, you could go for that too. But overall, you're going to have to dig deep and find some reason to keep going and be your own best coach. It's pretty heartbreaking but unfortunately it's the truth. 

Nobody's gonna save you but you.",pym9qr,n/a,2021-09-30 15:34:51

Finally figured out how to stop binge eating,"Okay so I’ve always struggled with binge eating junk food, especially confectionaries. I would have phases where I’d try to cut it out completely, or exercise self-control but more often than not, it would not last. Now, I have realised that the only way for me not to binge is to not buy packets of anything that have more than one serving. If I want a cookie, I go to Lidl/m&s and get a single cookie from the bakery. Before, I used to get those packet of four from Tesco, Sainsbury’, Morrisons and I would always end up finishing the whole thing. If I want cereal, I get a mini box(I always used to end up having multiple bowls of kraves or such). If I want chocolate, I buy a single bar not a packet.

I found it important to realise that I genuinely cannot exercise self control when there is a giant packet of chocolates or whatever it is in front of me. I might not finish it entirely but I’ll definitely have more than the prescribed single serving size on the packet. And it is not our fault because processed food is designed to have maximum palatability. I know I can’t cut out processed food entirely but I can control how much of it I buy and set myself up for success.

I hope this gives someone out there struggling with binge eating an idea of one way to mediate their tendencies.",1k4pb1j,n/a,2025-04-21 21:32:42

Binge-eating disorder (only late at night) - what worked for you guys?,"When I was in my teens I was obese, 15 years on and a lot of miles later I'm training for my first ultra. It may sound well and good - and to many I have 'beat my demons' - but I still have a binge-eating disorder.

I should be happy as anything given the pain cave I finally came out of but instead I'm constantly in depressing food abstinence or caning 5 chocolate bars in a row. Once I pop, I don't stop. Every night is a battle and I'm sick of it.

I am considering seeing a psychiatrist but corona etc.

I was wondering what is working for some of you guys?

The problem is only in the evenings. In the day I usually fast with absolutely no problems but the craving for a 'nightcap' food equivalent is too much.

How I Quit Binge Eating - A Guide for those who struggle,"
I used to binge eat 3x times a week in an excess of 3,000 calories or more. Food had an incredible amount of power over me. I was scared to go places because I was worried I would binge eat. I won't go over how it got to that place. But I'll tell you how I got out and now have the healthiest relationship with food that I've ever had.

#Step 1 - Understanding

**Reading List**
*Kathryn Hanson - Brain Over Binge
*Dr. Livingston - Never Binge Again
*Jack Trimpey - Rational Recovery + Taming the Feast Beast
*Charles Duhigg - The Power of Habit

The four books listed above are what gave me a good understanding of what binge urges really were and what was causing my binge urges.

###Insight 1 - All binges are caused by the urge to binge. 
You only binge to cope with the urge to binge and get the subsequent anxiety/anticipatory relief from the craving. This is explained best by Kathryn Hanson, although she is really taking Jack Trimpey's concept in RR and applying it to binge eating. There is no greater meaning to your binges. Thinking otherwise will actually validate your binges and make it harder to stop! Many things may trigger an urge, but the actual binge itself is always caused by the thought along the lines of ""Hey let's binge eat right now"". Everyone gets stressed, bored, angry, etc. But not everyone binges because they don't get the urge in the first place because they never developed that habit.


###Insight 2 - The urge to binge is not you, and comes from a different part of your brain that has no access to your voluntary muscles. 
This explains your ambivalence towards binge eating. Part of you REALLY wants to stop (why else you be reading a post called how to stop binge eating?), but part of you feels like it wants to binge eat. The part of you that wants to stop, is the real you, and the part that says binge eat can be dismissed.


###Insight 3 - You have total control over your voluntary movements and nothing - no thought, feeling, or sensation - can make you binge eat. 
Again going back to ""all binges are caused by the urge to binge"". Let's do a thinking exercise. Think about shaving your head right now. Really think about it and try to let that thought move your hands. No matter how much you try to convince yourself to shave your head, your hands probably haven't moved an inch. Because you actually don't want to shave your head. And you actually don't want to binge eat either, but you get tricked into thinking you do by thinking that thoughts that encourage binge eating have meaning or significance. If you can accept with 100% commitment that you NEVER want to binge eat and that all thoughts, feelings, and sensations telling you to binge eat are garbage, things become a lot easier. Accept that you have total control - NOTHING can make you binge eat, especially not mere thoughts. You are not powerless. 


###Insight 4 - Binge eating is nothing more than a really bad habit. 
How your binge eating habit started doesn't matter because now it wired into your brain. Your cravings to binge are just generated neurological impulses to carry out a habit in the same way that your urge to brush your teeth at night is from the same process. There is no greater meaning to your binges. Recognizing the cue for the habit (binge eating) and the reward (relief from the craving) can give you the space you need to stop immediately acting on the habit.


Again all of this makes a lot more sense if you read the books.


#Step 2 - Putting new beliefs into practice
My pivotal moment was doing the crash course in addictive voice recognition technique (AVRT) on Jack Trimpey's [website](http://www.rational.org/index.php?id=36). Mentally replace alcohol/drugs with binge eating, when you read through it. That was the thing that did it - that empowered me to fully stop binge eating. I had the power to stop all along. Using Kathryn Hanson's advice in Brain Over Binge, I dismissed all thoughts that encouraged binge eating. Before, a thought about binge eating would make me wildly upset, I'd get in a frenzy, panic, get angry/sad/annoyed, cave, and binge. Now I hear those thoughts with detachment. They can't make me do anything. And once you stop binge eating and acting out on these thoughts, the cravings and urges diminish over time.


#Step 3 - Getting back to normal eating


###1. Neutralize Food: The single greatest thing you can do for your mental and physical wellbeing (after you stop binge eating, of course) is to not let food have so much power over you. 
Stop treating food like a drug, a medicine, like this great unstoppable force, like your reason for living. It's just a donut. You can eat it and the universe will not explode. You can also not eat it, and likewise you'll be fine. The importance and power you give to food creates stress and causes you to obsess over it. ""Should I eat it or shouldn't I?"" over and over and over debating in your head as if your decision will cause WWIII. It's not that high stakes! Seriously. No other inanimate object likely causes you this much stress. Think of food in the same way, i.e. neutrally.


###2. Neutralize food obsession.
Normal people are not thinking about food all day outside of their meals. They get hungry, but they don't treat hunger as an emergency. It's just a sensation that doesn't need to be immediately satisfied. If you find yourself anxiously waiting for your next meal or obsessing/fantasizing about food, 1) don't judge those thoughts, 2) accept that they are there/don't try to get rid of them, and 3) don't get so wrapped up in them (this is basically mindfulness meditation 101 btw). These thoughts are no different than thoughts about binge eating. Neutralizing these thoughts and not letting them have power over you will allow you to move on and get back to what you were doing.


###3. Eating normally.
My eating plan now is very simple - 2-3 meals a day, no snacks. Generally I try to eat when hungry, stop when I'm full, which sounds simple but it used to feel impossible to do. But whenever I feel those crazed, frenzied thoughts saying ""Eat! Eat! Eat!"" that encourage me to act impulsively around food, I take a step back and think ""Bruh it's just food."" I relax basically and don't listen to those thoughts.
Now for those of you with more complex eating issues, this is where Dr. Livingstone's Never Binge Again comes in. He used to be obese and used the philosophy along Jack Trimpey's Rational Recovery to solve his bad food habits. [https://www.eatlikeanormalperson.com/](https://www.eatlikeanormalperson.com/) is also a good website for a simple eating plan. She also had binge eating disorder for years and was obese but overcame her food issues. 

4. This one is sort of an aside but don't food orgasm. You know when you're eating something really tasty or you're eating when you're super HUNGRy and you're thinking ""oh my fucking god this is sooooooOOOOoooOOO good!!!"" and you're in like complete ecstasy? Stop doing that. You're treating food like a drug. Be grateful for food. Find pleasure in food and see it as an enjoyable activity. But for god's sake don't food orgasm. #NeutralizeFood

Finally as a closing note, I'd like to say that all of these things are skills that you can develop. Having the right mindset -- believing that you can stop, that you never want to binge eat, that you have 100% power over your voluntary movements, etc. -- will be a huge asset in your journey.

PS. All of the books listed can be found online for free except for Jack Trimpey's book, but he does offer a free course on his website.",g2v0wh,n/a,2020-04-17 04:33:39
Just because you go keto it doesn’t mean that binge eating tendencies disappear.,"Ugh. This is mostly a mini rant.
I have been doing keto for 5 weeks. I’m doing well and happy. Most of the time I’m not that hungry, but some days I get crazy hungry and just get the munchies. It might be the Easter holiday mindset creeping in from the past, but today is feeling like a struggle. I’ve been avoiding keto treats because sweets tend to trigger my desire to binge eat and this is the first year that I can remember that I have passed on Easter candy, but I really want to dive head first into a bag of jelly beans and some Cadbury eggs.

AITAH for reporting my wife for bringing me snacks in the hospital?,"I am 32 and male. About two years ago, I was diagnosed with Binge Eating Disorder. To put it simply, I eat compulsively, even when not hungry. My BMI is 43, putting me in the Class III obesity range.

Since my diagnosis, I have not improved whatsoever. Therapy and support groups have a positive effect on my mentality, but even two hours after I'll be in line at a drive-through. It has affected my health, my mental health, my finances, and of course my wife.

My wife is 37. She is average-sized and eventually agreed that I may need actual medical intervention. After a lot of deliberation, we packed up and temporarily moved states so I could participate in an inpatient program as part of a research study. Apparently, intervention programs for BED can be pretty hit or miss, and so this one is a new take on them, being six months instead of the typical 30 to 90 days.

I am currently at the end of my first month, and everything is going very well. I've made a lot of friends in the program as well. At the end of the one-month mark, visitation opened up and my wife could now visit me. Obviously she jumped at the chance and came to visit me two days ago.

We headed over to my room, where she took her backpack off and pulled out jalapeno chips and colas--two of my most common binge items. At first I freaked out, but she explained that I ""deserved a break"" and went into detail about how much trouble she went through to smuggle them through. I immediately shouted for a nurse who forcefully removed the products from her hands and then escorted her out of the hospital with a full team. 

My wife has now been completely banned from the premises. And she's furious at me. The nurses and doctors have expressed nothing but gratitude and told me that had I indulged I would have instantly been removed from the program. 

One thing that my wife said that made me think she had a point was instead of telling her to put the snacks away and take them home, I went for the nuclear option of calling other people. I know that her bringing me snacks was objectively wrong, but was my reaction over the top?",1dh4p0g,n/a,2024-06-16 10:28:30

That slowness in losing is heavily due to the fact that I have disordered eating. I suffer from BED, have purged in the past, and have no connection with my biological hunger cues whatsoever. This has caused several lost weeks due to binging the calories I burned through cutting.

Today is my day off, however, and I ordered Chipotle. I ordered chips and queso, and a burrito bowl. I ate about a quarter of my burrito bowl, about half of the chips and less than half of the queso. A would-be 1800 calorie binge turned into a 700 calorie meal. I didn’t even go over my calories for a cutting day. This is HUGE for me. And I actually recognize that I feel full. Slow progress is progress, my dudes. Making small, sustainable changes leads to results that will last. I couldn’t be happier.

Edit:

Yo, I was expecting 30 upvotes and a “good job”. 😅 the amount of support I have received here is WILD. Thank you all so much. One thing I was not expecting was how lonely the road to weight loss would be. Seeing the support y’all are giving me makes me feel a lot less alone.

What’s one “healthy” habit you realized was secretly sabotaging your weight loss?,"For me, it was doing fasted workouts every morning because I thought it would help burn more fat.

I’d wake up, drink coffee, and train without eating, felt “hardcore” at first… until I realized I was:

* Crashing mid-workout
* Binge eating later in the day
* Feeling super drained and moody

Once I started eating a small snack beforehand (like half a banana or protein shake), I had more energy and found it easier to stay in control later in the day.

Sometimes what feels healthy isn’t helping at all.

Curious: what’s one “healthy” habit you let go of that made your progress actually better?",1lw9wsj,n/a,2025-07-10 11:05:33
Being fat ruined my life,"Literally every problem I (36F) have is because I can't stop eating. I want to change but I don't know if I ever will. 

I'm broke because I spend too much money on junk food.

I haven't bought any new clothes because everything I tried on in the dressing room looked terrible. I hate looking at the mirror.

I don't apply for higher paying jobs because I'm worried about what to wear at the interview. 

I'm too insecure about my body to date or have sex. 

I don't like going to events or meeting new people because I fear people will judge me.

My parents are disappointed in me.

I avoid the doctor because I don't want to find out I have pre-diabetes. My mom is pre-diabetic and my grandfather died of diabetes related complications in his 60s. If I don't change, it's almost guaranteed I will get it. And it will be my fault. Knowing all of this, I still had one of the worst binge eating episodes in a long time this weekend.

I'm 5'3"" and 200lbs. I'm always tired. I've had heartburn so terrible that I thought I was having a heart attack.

A week ago, I vowed to lose weight. The most I did was wake up early a few times this week to go to the gym. I already take antidepressants, I don't want to also take Ozempic. I don't want to have GLP-1 subscription for the rest of my life. I probably wouldn't be able to afford it anyway. 

By the time I reach my goal, I'll be nearly 38 years old. It'll probably be too late for me to live the life I truly want anyway. Being fat really did ruin my life.

**EDIT:** Wow. I did not expect so many comments. Thank you everyone! I may not get a chance to respond to every comment but I will read every single one. I will write down every piece of advice here in a notebook, seek professional help and find out what is best for me. 

**EDIT:** I recently switched to a new therapist and told her some of my issues with body image. Sometimes I forget to take my medication, so it's not as effective as it should be. I usually talk about stuff like family problems, being on the spectrum and social anxiety but I am going to talk to her about my plans on seeing a doctor.

**EDIT:** In the past decade: I have tried HCG Diet, WW, Noom, 6-Week Weight Loss Challenge, starving for nearly two days and probably more stuff I don't remember. WW, Noom and 6 Week Challenges do work if you commit to them. I've lost as much as 25 pounds before gaining it back :(

**EDIT:** I wasn't always fat despite always having a huge appetite. I was athletic. I even played sports as a kid. I preferred playing outside over TV and video games.  To make a long story short, things changed during adolescence and I became withdrawn and anxious. The only time I even got close to a normal weight as an adult was when I went from 168 to 145 when I was 18. All I did was start eating slightly better. I stayed around 145-155 throughout my early twenties. I hated my body back then too. Now, I'll be grateful if I ever get close to 145 again. ",1jpb35i,n/a,2025-04-02 00:10:09
Obese woman-child president of HOA I'm not a part of had a fatal heart attack while feuding with me ,"Just to preface, yes this did take place in the USA. And no I won't say where. I'll include a TLDR as well. I live bordering a former HOA. It shut down about a year ago. My property is the closest one to them, but far enough away that it does not fall in their jurisdiction since I am not on their street. My property is next to their street, and my driveway enters from the main road. The HOA's road is more than a half mile of houses. Some really old, But the street was redeveloped in the 90s or so. And after that, an HOA was started. You go from a country road and then take a right turn, and bam, you're in semi-suburbia. There are large farms on each side of the former HOA road. The oldest houses were among those owned by the HOA board. And there is also an old small elementary school that was converted into a home by one of the board members. And that was also where the HOA had all their meetings.

When I moved into the area a couple of years ago, it was because I'd come into some money from inheritance, and decided to buy a semi-suburban small town property that had been vacant for several years after the previous house that was on it burned down. The land itself was cheap and heavily overgrown with brush. Once cleared out, I had a manufactured home put there. There was even an existing chain link fence with a gate that kept the property lines well divided. I had enough inheritance money to pay for about 50% of all this without effecting my prior savings. And the rest I had to take on a mortgage for. It's just the sort of property I wanted. A little place of my own where I can work remotely. And if I ever have to move, I can probably sell the place for roughly three times what I paid for it. But I hope to stay here as long as I can. I'm the type who likes to stay firmly planted somewhere. And I hate traveling.

I'd only been living in my current abode for a few days when I suddenly began getting trouble from the nearby HOA. The rotund HOA president showed up along with a couple of her board members on a trio of mobility scooters like they were some kinda biker gang. They had notepads in hand and creepy smiles that I can only describe as looking like they already won from the moment they'd arrived. I made the mistake of leaving my gate unlocked, and they just let themselves in. But they quickly learned I was not gonna let them force me into joining their little club. Before I could even tell them to get out, they'd already spread out. The president was giving me a pitch that the HOA was mandatory, and the other two people started telling me about all the bylaws I was supposedly in violation of. One of them being the state of my grass. Which was at the time almost non-existent because the ground had been leveled and re-seeded when my house was set up. I had none of their attitudes, and told them to leave. They refused and said they had a right to be there, and actually stated that my information from real estate that my property wasn't in their jurisdiction was wrong. I told them that was a stupid lie, and to get off my property. They refused to leave, so I had enough and went into my house, then came back out my old 22 rifle I've had since I was a kid, and threatened them with it. It's just a 22, but it's not a small rifle. So it looks intimidating enough

They lost their minds in panic at the sight of the rifle, and actually called the police on me instead of clearing out when I told them to. But the police sided with me after they arrived because the HOA board were all trespassing, and I was was fully within my rights to defend my own property. The stunned looks on their faces were gold when the police took my side, and told them to leave me alone since I was not in their HOA. The president whined about it repeatedly. But it did nothing because the cops also agreed I was not in the HOA's area of control, and they were overreaching their authority. Then they were all then forced to leave. Somehow they thought I'd be a pushover just because I look young. I was 36 at the time, and people still often mistake me for being mid 20s. I had a babyface growing up, and even tried growing a mustache for a while to look more mature. Didn't work out very well.

The HOA didn't quit trying to make me join. At first I was just getting membership applications in the mail. But then they started getting more passive aggressive. One of the board members even waited for me at my gate about a couple of weeks after the first incident just to tell me that my refusing to conform was ruining neighborhood moral. I reminded him I'm not in his neighborhood, and he told me he could have me shunned if I didn't join. I actually laughed at him for that. I bought a country property to be left alone. Go ahead and shun me. I've got my own friends in the nearby city if I want to see them. Then told the guy to stay away from my property. And if he ever trespassed again, I'd have him arrested. Right after that I started getting warnings in the mail for supposed infractions I'd committed. They actually sent me repeated warnings over the re-seeded grass. Did they not understand how newly planted grass grows? It takes a while to fill in. Then it stopped being warnings, and they sent me a long list of fines they expected me to pay. The fines were for me for having a gate, the gate being yellow, preventing mandatory inspection of my land and house, owning a firearm, having a car in the wrong color, my fence being old and rusty (It was already there when I bought the land), my fence being too tall (6 feet), my driveway not being paved (It's gravel), and they didn't consider my recently installed at the time metal shed an approved building. But that wasn't all. There were more fines going back years to the previous property owners, and the period my property sat vacant and overgrown. They actually expected me to pay in total they thirty thousand dollars.

I was especially livid after they had sent me that list of bogus fines, because they'd have had to have trespassed on my property just to know some of the things they were fining me for. Honestly I think they were just making up rules at some point to claim I'd broken them. I walked the neighborhood, and there were plenty of other rusty fences, patchy lawns, gravel driveways, cars the same color as mine, etc. I had to calm myself down with a drink, and then wrote a letter back stating I was not in the HOA, never will be, and would not pay anything to them. Especially not for anything from before I ever even owned the property. I also made it clear their attempts to fine me were blatantly illegal, if not outright fraud, and would not hold up in court. After that, my garbage can was vandalized after I put it out before going to work. It looked like it'd been cut up with an electric saw or something. I called the cops. But there was little they could do with no witnesses.

I had enough and paid a security company to come set up cameras. The HOA board took notice of the work vehicle from the security company as I saw the same two board members who previously harassed me sitting on scooters and watching from the end of my driveway. They clearly took my threat of retaliation seriously, because I got no more fake fines, and my trash can was never touched again. But they still kept sending me membership applications weekly, and even letters practically begging I just join to keep the peace. So I started mailing them back with ""NO!"" written in black sharpie on the envelopes. And even a letter threatening to wipe my ass with their applications before sending them back. And even that didn't make it stop. For a while I could not for the life of me figure out why they were so desperate to make me join. Turned out their elderly woman-child of an HOA president had practically become obsessed with some crazy plan she was calling HOA Zone Expansion. And was making it a hill to die on since the HOA could not legally expand beyond it's street without permission from surrounding property owners. And I highly doubt any of them would agree to join. I was just target #1 because I was the closest. And they wanted to make an example of me.

I just kept rebuffing the HOA's repeated attempts to contact me. Until one morning about three months after I'd moved in, I found my driveway blocked by a large transit van outside my gate. It was the HOA president, and she was blocking me in so she could personally make demands of me. I don't know why she bothered to use her van to block me in. She was already big as a whale, and could have just stood there herself. I even started calling her President Whale behind her back because she was morbidly obese to the My 600 Pound Life level, and often wore blue and white. She had on what I can best describe as a business jacket over a moo-moo dress, hair in a tight bun, big grandma glasses, and a beaded necklace with a big wooden cross hanging from her neck. And I'm not exaggerating when I say she usually had some kind of food in her hands. Like almost every time I saw her. Even during this interaction she stopped to eat. From what I learned of her later, she was a widow. And her husband was an obese person like her, that ate himself into his grave during his 50s. As for President whale. I do believe she had something very mentally wrong with her. But I wasn't sympathetic after what she tried to do to me.

Back to her van blocking me in. I told President Whale to move her damn vehicle, or I'd be calling the effing police on her. She scolded me like an old church lady for my choice of language, and said she didn't have to move because the HOA owns the road. And since I refused to join the HOA, or pay the fines, she was landlocking me in. Even I knew this was very illegal, and asked if she was mental, because I'm not even on the HOA's road. I'm on the main road the HOA road branches from. She refused to listen to me, so I started getting ready to call police. She tried to stop me from calling and claimed she just wanted to negotiate. I told her there was nothing to negotiate. She was blocking me in illegally, and I would be calling cops if she didn't move her van ASAP. But she pretended not to even hear me and said that if I just filled out the forms to join the HOA, all of my problems would go away. Then she went on a ""The HOA is so great!"" sales pitch, and refused to stop till I told her she was trying to act like a mafia boss, and the HOA was the source of all my problems she was claiming would go away. Then I said that all the junkfood she was eating was rotting her brain. She called me a petulant child. I reminded her I was a grown ass man, and she was a hypocrite to call me petulant when she was the one illegally blocking me in to try and blackmail me into joining her HOA.

She had the nerve to say what she was doing was morally right, and for the good of the community. I said back that it wasn't, it was just to satisfy her own ego, and blackmail is illegal. I also pointed out she wasn't being a good Christian by wearing a cross and claiming such lies. She rolled up the HOA forms and aimed to swat me with them. I had enough and finally called the police. Whale started screaming at me to hang up the call while attempting to chase me around and hit me. But the slow pile of blubber couldn't even get near me. After only a couple of attempts, she stopped and started wheezing. And then she started yelling to try and get the police on the phone to think I was attacking her. I called her out for this, and reminded her I have cameras. She immediately stopped and then waddled back to her van a tired sweaty mess. We stared each other down for around 20 minutes while she sat in the side of her van and stuffed her face before the cops showed up. They were initially unsure what was going on because of Whale's prior screaming when I called. But I had video from my dash-cam and my house to show I'd never laid a finger on her.

President Whale tried to make a big show of fake panic, and said I was dangerous. But the police told her to move her van as she was illegally blocking my driveway. She refused and said the road was the HOA's. But the cops said it wasn't the first time they'd been called because of her harassment in the area, and also stated that the road she was currently on, was not the HOA's road. And the road the HOA itself is on, is county owned, not private. Which was news to me. But it meant she couldn't do this, even if I was on the HOA's road. Then she was bluntly told she cannot block access to anyone, and to move the van right away, or be cited. She tried to argue further, so they ticketed her on the spot, and threatened to arrest her and have the van towed if she didn't comply. She gave us all death glares and finally moved the van. I arrived to work about an hour late that day. But with an interesting story to tell.

Not too long later I was served a small claims lawsuit from Whale. She was suing me for the cost of the fine she had to pay for the citation police gave her, and for emotional distress I caused that was affecting her health. I pretty much looked at the letter and laughed, because I was ready to pick that land whale apart in court. But then the HOA tried another dirty move around the same time. I was soon notified by my bank that someone was attempting to put a lien on my property for 30k. The same amount as what the HOA tried to previously fine me. I finally got a lawyer, and the lien was soon canceled because it was groundless. I filed counter lawsuits against Whale and the HOA for harassment. I also personally went to see the HOA board at their next meeting to tell them off for what they'd tried to do, and that I'd see them in court. Whale actually had one of those little wooden gavel mallets, and was repeatedly striking it on the table that she was sitting at. She pounded it on the table while yelling ""NOOOO!"" every time I tried to speak. The rest of the HOA board had to tell her to stop, and even took the gavel from her hand like she was a child that needed a time-out. She went on a tangent about how she was in charge. But the rest of the board told her to she needed to pack up and go home for the day. But she refused and just sat there with her arms crossed and pouting.

I talked with the rest of the board, and they tried to deny any involvement in the past things Whale had done to me. Including the attempted lien, which was only her doing apparently. I called those as outright lies, and pointed out how several of the board members had previously harassed me in person along with whale at my house, and they were also likely the ones who snuck onto my property to write more fines until I put cameras up. Because I certainly wouldn't figure Whale was the one climbing over my gate and trudging around like that with how fat she is. I then said I was suing them for the harassment, fake fines, and attempted lien on my property, and my destroyed trash can if I could prove it. I'd see them in court to take them for everything I could, because they were royally effed! Their faces all seemed to get flushed, save for Whale. She was puffy and red like a ripe tomato. I was then politely asked to leave so they could deliberate.

Not long after that, things came to an abrupt halt. Only a few days after I'd went to see the HOA board, President Whale was found dead in her home from a fatal heart attack. Apparently it had been brought on by stress and binge eating because the board had refused to stand by her, and voted to dismiss her as HOA president after I told them I was suing. I heard she had a full on child tantrum. I only wish I'd still been there to see it. Apparently she begged them to reconsider, and they packed her things for her and made her leave sobbing. She went home, and then died on her couch while binge eating cake. She lived alone, so nobody found her for days. And the morgue had a hell of a time getting her remains out of the house. She was in her mid sixties and morbidly obese with a serious junk food addiction. So she was basically one twinkie away from kicking the bucket at any time.

My lawsuit against the HOA ended when they agreed to settle out of court after Whale's death. They basically blamed everything on her. They claimed the fines and false lien were only her doing. Though I still don't really believe that. But the board wormed out of any serious consequences since it was Whale's name on all the paperwork. In the settlement the HOA paid all my legal fees, repaid the cost of my having to get CCTV cameras installed, and gave me a few thousand dollars on top of all that as a show of good faith. But Whale's family decided they were gonna come after both me and the HOA. They tried to sue both me and them for causing Whale's death. But the judge threw both cases out before they even went to court. I ended up getting a few anonymous threatening letters taped to my gate talking about things like breaking my legs. And the houses of each HOA board member got vandalized too. My mailbox was also ripped up out of the ground in the middle of the night. Joke was on them. I get all of my mail through a PO Box. Sadly I didn't have a camera at the end of the driveway to see who did it. I'd previously tried putting a trail cam there, but passing cars set it off all day and night. So I removed it.

The mailbox was only really there as an address marker anyway. And wasn't hard for me to replace. But tampering with a mailbox, even one that's basically just for display, is a federal offense. It couldn't be proven it was Whale's family that did it, as there were no cameras or witnesses that saw anything, and my mailbox was never found. But Whale's family vandalizing of the HOA board members' houses were all provable as there were cameras there, and those idiots didn't bother to cover their faces when they did all that damage. Some arrests were made, and a lot of restraining orders were filed. Whale's family finally sold her house and left. Guess they weren't stupid enough to go against a restraining order. I just replaced my display mailbox with one from Home Depot, and that's pretty much where the entire mess ends for me.

The whole situation was too much for the HOA though. And the residents passed a motion to shut it down completely. The HOA served no real function for comfort as there were no paid for common areas like a park or a pool. All meetings were held at the house of one of the board members, which as I said used to be a small school. There were accusations of repeated election rigging, as the board had remained the same for a long time, despite the fact they were so hated. And there were threats of an audit too. The board didn't fight the shut-down because they were all on the verge of being removed by force, so they were ready to throw in the towel. A couple of them even moved away. One of which I heard said that I had ruined everything, and the neighborhood was going to hell without the HOA. The former board were all retired busybodies anyway. The only one that's any semblance of liked, is the one who's house used to be a school and the HOA meeting building. They opened the gym room so locals could come in and play basketball on the regular. Their kids love it especially. I've been living peacefully here ever since, and I have actually made some friends. I didn't intend to. But I stopped to talk with neighbors a few times while out riding my bike, and it just went on from there. I've even been invited to a few barbecues and even a birthday party. Life is good.

TLDR: HOA harassed me for months to join. Obese woman-child president tried to fine me for anything she could think of, and even put a lien on my property. And she blocked my driveway by claiming she was landlocking me in. I sued the HOA, the HOA fired the president, the former president died from a heart attack caused by binge eating, then her family went on a revenge rampage, and then the HOA soon disbanded because they likely rigged elections and were threatened with an audit. Neighborhood is much better without the HOA.",1fiqyz3,n/a,2024-09-17 05:29:08

Hopefully Final Update on Am I the Asshole if I Don't Serve as Much Food as My Guests Want?,"First off, thanks to everyone who responded kindly. I'm still working through all the private messages, and I'll get there. Also, I'm still working on remembering the whole lasagna recipe. I'll post it when I do.

First, an apology. I knew Polly didn't use Reddit, but I was foolish and didn't think that Melissa might. I was out of line with some of what I said, like calling it a live mukbang show, and for that I apologize. This post was not supposed to be about fat-shaming, and I did, in my comments, fat-shame. That is on me, and I apologize. I do not hate Melissa for being obese. My problem has solely been about the etiquette and fairness of the food consumption and the stress it puts on me to see someone binge-eat so severely when I battle that disorder.

Update...  
That day they came to my house, I did eventually speak to Melissa and Polly after they calmed down. Melissa has always dreamed of having friends who would accept her as she is and be in a group where she can eat the way she does without judgment. Polly believed that I would provide that. I told them that I cannot, because I almost ate myself to death, and helping someone else do it is too much. Also, most of my other guests were uncomfortable. I said I would provide double portions to Melissa (which is a LOT of food), but no more. I did not mention the cost, because I didn't want them to offer to pay as a way around it.

They said they'd think about it, but Polly messaged me a few days later and said that she could not forgive me humiliating her partner online unless I showed true remorse by ""giving Melissa what she needs"" (an unlimited buffet at my home). So our friendship is over. Another member of the group has sided with Polly, upset at the fact that I discussed this online.

So that is where we're at. My group has shrunk. We'll grow again; there are a few people we are going to discuss who might make good additions. But we skipped this month's party because of the stress and drama.

As to whether I should have discussed it online at all... I've decided that I'm not sorry for that. I changed enough details that someone outside the circle would not recognize it. Some genders, names, ages, medical conditions, who has what career, which relatives I live with, who has what career, have been altered to preserve anonymity. I needed advice, and I thought anonymously online would be better than asking a bunch of people I knew, because I did not want to tell people who knew Melissa what happened.

Edited to add:  
Here is the lasagna recipe as well as I can remember it. No, I do not photograph my food. Too old for that trend.

Edited to add... I remember now that Melissa did go to the bathroom I think twice during the meal. I'm wondering if she purged in those trips. That would make it easier to consume that much food.",1ixi4ix,n/a,2025-02-25 00:45:39
"In April of '19, we lost our youngest son. Sent me into a spiral of depression and binge eating. That June, I decided to use his death as motivation to change. I lost 150lb and gained self respect. I used to weight 340lb and dropped to 190lb.","I won't go into crazy detail unless people want.

Lost our son, it devastated me. Used that event to spur motivation to change my life, since I wanted to be around for our oldest son. 340lb at 30 years old doesn't lead itself to a long life.

Lost the weight, built some muscle, ran a 5k, changed my life.

EDIT:

Since people asked. My son was born April 1st in 2019. His name is Weylin. At birth, he was strong and healthy with no concerns. However, my wife tested positive for Strep Group B, so they had her on antibiotics at the time of delivery.

Three weeks into his life, he wasn't feeding. He would cry softly, and not eat. He eventually started keeping his eyes closed and go limp. 

We rushed him to urgent care, and his BP and temp were low. They did a series of tests and found that he has a bacterial infection in his brain caused by the SGB. Ultimately, it traveled to his brain stem, and we had to decide to take him off life support.

This devasted me. More than I knew possible. While I never had suicidal thoughts, had it continued, it likely could have gotten there. I remember vividly my wife and I trying to keep a brave face for our oldest (at the time 2). He didn't know where his brother went, but he would see us sad.

My weight ballooned more than it ever had. I just kept eating. I didn't know whether out of grief or what, but either way, I was constantly binging and just feeling terrible. One night, I had just finished my Toppers medium pizza, my wife's half of her pizza, and 14 chicken wings, and I broke down about how miserable I was.

I decided to make the change and get my life under control. I wouldn't be around much longer if I let things continue as they did. I redownloaded MyFitness Pal, deleted all my history, got my TDEE (total daily energy expenditure - maintenance calories) from tdeecalculator.net and started fresh. Just counting calories and eating 1000 calories less than my maintenance every day.

A year later, I had lost 150lb, I started working on gaining muscle, I ran a 5k, and my life has been 1000% better ever since. I have confidence back and my wife and I just welcomed our third child Fynnigan into our lives.

Thank you for all the support <3",n3wiw0,n/a,2021-05-03 13:48:55
Anybody struggle with binge eating once you’ve stopped drinking?,"I have just recently made the choice to not drink and i’m close to a week sober after 5 years of drinking beers heavily daily. i’ve kept active during my time drinking, running 4-6 miles 4-5 days a week and weight lifting 3-4 days a week. so i didn’t gain much weight. however, since i’ve stopped i have noticed an increase in my food intake and i just can’t stop eating… is this normal? if so what did you do to try and slow it down?

I've traded in binge drinking for binge eating.,"Hello my friends;

First and foremost I am 174 days alcohol free today and feeling reasonably good about that. I've been doing my best to count calories, work out 3-5 times a week, walk more, and by all accounts it's been going fairly well. I've even managed to lose some weight.

HOWEVER.

I find that after 5 to 6 days of adhering to my diet, I get an absolutely unreal craving for sugar, or just food in general. But mostly sugar. 

I'm talking driving 10 - 15 minutes down the road at 9:30pm to get an enormous ice cream cone before the shop closes, smashing that, then driving another 10 minutes to the grocery store to get a gross amount of sweets and snacks and absolutely gorging myself on the stuff, sometimes as soon as I get in the car. 

I eat, and eat, and eat, until by the end of the night I feel like garbage and think of myself as garbage. 

I've heard that sugar cravings can have a correlation to dehydration and have tried to stay on top of that, but it's so hard sometimes. Just like when I was drinking, I find that it's so difficult to over come the compulsion, even when in the same breath I know I'm not doing myself any favors. 

I am looking for advice, encouragement, or personal experiences any of you have had with this issue. 

TL;DR: I've been doing well without alcohol but have started bingeing food once or twice a week and it's ruining my gains/weight loss. Tell me how you deal with it.

Anyone here have serious binge eating or over eating issues?,"If so, how does it happen? Is it from stress, boredom, tiredness etc. I am curious because I have had this problem for a while and it’s one of the reasons I want to get medicated after I get assessed. It often happens out of boredom and it’s a lot of snacking. Sometimes I don’t realize I’m eating until a few seconds and I eat random things. I was eating sugar earlier because I was bored then my mom looks at me and asks me why I’m eating small bites of sugar . I also have lots of eating disorder history but even before that it all started with overeating which lead to me having an eating disorder and starving to lose weight then years later gaining half of it back. What is the correlation ?",rq1yym,n/a,2021-12-28 00:39:22
Unhinged advice on how to stop binge eating,"Please I am a chronic binge eater, it’s literally an addiction. I compare it to alcoholism or drug addiction because I’m exactly like that just with food 

Don’t tell me “eat high protein and complex carbs to stay full longer” - I’m always full! I just can’t stop eating. 

I could eat 24/7 all day I eat out of boredom and being sad. Right now I have major life stressors and am always sad. 

Anytime I restrict myself and stop, I do great for up to 2-3 weeks. I discipline myself well for a short period of time, then it takes one bad day to throw me off track for 1-3 months. 

What can actually help me stop binge eating? 

I’ve put pictures of myself when I was skinny around my pantry and fridge area, which I now ignore. I left a pair of my jeans when I was skinny hanging up on my closet door, which I also now ignore. 

I need to lose 60lbs that I gained post pregnancy. I’m 1 year Pp, separated from my deadbeat husband (stressor as I am solely responsible for our child for the last year), and gained so much weight PP that I can’t seem to take control of 

Edit: I grew up my entire life overweight/obese. At my heaviest I was 250lbs 5’10. In 2020 I managed to successfully lose weight (80lbs) and kept it off until I fell pregnant in 2024. Since then I’ve gained 60lbs 

I’m still breastfeeding so I can’t go on most medications, and am already in therapy consistently for about 1.5 years ",1lbvhwo,n/a,2025-06-15 08:33:21
Every and any tip you can give me to quit binge eating even if it’s something completely ridiculous,"Hey ya’ll it’s me again 😎 

Please do not look at my profile if you’re easily annoyed by people constantly crying and complaining and then not doing anything about it. But dear fucking Lord I want to do something about it so badly but this switch just will not flip for me to have even an ounce of motivation. 

If you do look at my previous posts, I’m currently on a waitlist to be assessed for ADHD. Even if it’s determined I do have it, it’s another 7 months on a waitlist for medication. Well if I don’t get a handle on my binge eating in the mean time I’ll be dead before I ever even get assessed. 

I binge nearly every day. I hate the way I look, I feel ashamed, I was never flexible but I’m noticing I’m getting less flexible. 

So please give me anything for me to try, anything to try and get my motivation going because apparently hating myself isn’t enough

"My wife [34F] is spiraling and I [36M] am tired of covering for her. I need her to get her weight under control, but we've been down this road before and it always eventually falls apart. How can I help her see I'm serious and salvage this?","Before I get started, I want to make one thing clear: I love my wife. She's the mother of my two children, she's intelligent and funny, and I have always been and remain attracted to her. She's always been heavier since we first met, and I've never had a problem with that except insofar as it effects our family's quality of life, as I'll explain below.

For some background, we have been married for nine years and she has steadily gained weight over the course of our marriage. This was particularly exacerbated by a difficult pregnancy, which was immediately followed by the COVID lockdowns and her losing her long-term job. Things continued to get out of hand until early last year, when some incidents finally convinced her to see a doctor and get control of things. Her weight was well over 500 lbs, and her doctor prescribed her Zepbound and recommended she start seeing a therapist. This worked fairly well for a while, (though she almost immediately quit therapy), and by the end of last summer she had lost over 20 lbs. She had also generally improved her outlook, gotten a part-time job, and was much more active. We loved taking walks together.

Things took a turn for the worse in two ways last fall: first, my job switched insurance plans to one that didn't cover glp-1s for weight loss, and second, a family member passed away pretty suddenly, which caused her a lot of grief and stress. She was home from work for about a month on bereavement after the passing, and at the same time her binge eating, which had been suppressed by Zepbound, returned with a fury. This bled into the Holidays, which are obviously not good for anyone's waistline, and this year she's basically fallen back into all of her old habits. I don't know her current weight, but she's definitely gained back everything she lost plus some.

Here's where the advice portion starts: I've had to start adjusting my life in a lot of ways to accommodate her limitations, and the list grows longer every week. While by no means exhaustive, the list includes:

* She is unable to put on socks or shoes or trim her toenails on her own.
* Always needs my help getting up from our sofa, which is pretty low, or from playing with the kids on the floor
* I have to drive her to work and the kids to school despite working from home myself, because she is too big to safely fit behind the wheel
* When friends invite us out, I have to make excuses to cancel plans and lie to them to avoid admitting things like, ""no we can't come because she can't stand up for that long"". Our social life is in the tank
* Our romantic life sucks. Basically all dates are staying in to get takeout and watch a movie, because she gets anxious about restaurants, can't fit in movie theaters, and can't do most things that involve physical activity
* Most weekdays when she isn't working she barely leaves bed, leaving me to work full-time and do all of the child-care at the same time once they're home from school.
* Grocery shopping is a nightmare because she can't really stay standing for long enough, but is too proud to use one of the store scooters, so she stays in the car and calls me on my air-pods and tells me what to get. And if I refuse her anything, suddenly I'm being manipulative or insulting her weight. The whole thing makes me feel like a drug dealer or something.

Every week on Sunday she basically hypes herself up about how this will be the week to turn everything around, but then she never changes anything. And if I remind her of what she said and try to curb her eating choices I'm ""not being helpful"". I'm honestly getting really sick of all this and feel close to snapping. To top everything off, my job was partially funded by federal grant money, so as of two weeks ago I'm unemployed and looking for work. I can't handle everything that I'm being asked to do and the stress is killing me to the point I frequently fantasize about running away, just booking a plane ticket and leaving her to deal with things for a weekend. I would never actually do that, but it makes me feel like a terrible husband and father to even have those thoughts. I feel like I'm living in a loop of broken promises and plans every week and I don't know how to get it to stick. Obviously I will be heavily considering the health insurance plan for wherever I look into working next, as glp-1s have been the only thing to really help so far.

How can I show her how much I'm hurting without looking shallow or selfish? How can I get one of her diet attempts to stick while we wait for another opportunity to get on drugs? For the foreseeable future I'm going to have to keep doing extra, because she can't physically help right now with a lot of things, but I need a plan and an end in sight or I'm gonna go nuts.",1jcsizd,n/a,2025-03-16 18:46:54
I am someone who overcame binge eating disorder after a decade of struggle—AMA,"I battled binge eating disorder for over ten years, starting in my early 20s. At my heaviest, I weighed 165 lbs on a 5’2” frame, despite exercising for hours daily and resorting to ‘digestive’ teas for ‘cleansing’ after consuming thousands of calories in a binge. It was a dark and exhausting cycle that consumed some of my best years.

Recovery wasn’t easy, but through therapy, self-work, and discipline, I have not binged in two years and have maintained a 35 lb weight loss for the last four. Today, I can confidently say I am 100% recovered.

If you’re struggling with binge eating, disordered eating habits, or recovery, I’d love to help. Ask me anything!

Edit: I should clarify that the hours of exercise and tea consumption were only a temporary phase at the peak of my weight gain, not something I did for the entire decade. I was diagnosed with BED because it was the most consistent pattern in my behavior.",1iwjxjf,n/a,2025-02-23 20:39:45
Made it a week without binge eating!,"I met my goal weight around February and have been maintaining since then. I'd done pretty well when I was at school, but moving back home because of COVID has been causing me to struggle. I eventually figured out that IF eating from 3-8pm works for me, but in that window I've still been eating too much.

 The week before last I binge ate pretty badly, gained 2 pounds in 5 days, and felt absolutely horrible and out of control. I cried at my desk for an hour, then on Thursday of last week I decided I was going to make my goal just not binging for a week, not trying to loose or maintain my weight, but just stopping when I feel full.  And I did it! 7 days today without binging. I had a couple spots where I ate a little more than I should have, and I let myself stress eat outside of my time limit once, but I stopped myself from going too far. I held on to my control, didn't punish myself for failing, and told myself that messing up didn't mean I had to keep eating. I could still stop, it wouldn't hurt me and I wasn't a bad person for going over a little.

I didn't count calories, but I did notice that there were several trigger foods that had caused me to go on binges before, and I cut 5 of those out completely for the week- cookies, cake, chips, chocolate, and cereal. I have no idea why they all start with C lol, but it checks out- I have trouble with cinnamon bread, candy, and coconut bars too. I wrote down my '5Cs' on my arm every morning to help keep myself in check. 

This morning I weighed myself after not looking all week- I didn't loose any of the weight I'd gained before when I was binging, but I'm reminding myself that that wasn't my goal, self control was. I'm not sure what my goal for this week will be. I'm thinking  about removing one of the Cs from my list and trying to see if I can incorporate it back into my diet and still not binge. I'm really hopeful that if I can work on managing my self control now it'll mean in the long run it won't be so much mental work to keep my healthy weight, it'll be automatic.",g2hzvs,n/a,2020-04-16 16:17:50

"2 Years' Progress (140lbs->117->128): binge eating, to running, to lifting on a vegan diet (Female, 5""6)","So I'm posting this partially out of tradition, as I posted my progress a year ago today and wanted to update. 

So two years ago, February 2015 (age 19), I looked like this:
http://imgur.com/TaBGbhL

Coming out of a nasty breakup and a year alone at a uni I hated, I was winding down from an episode of binge eating and a completely sedentary lifestyle. I didn't count calories at all but looking back, I think I could say I was putting away around 5,000 calories a day on some days. I barely left bed, and chronic insomnia meant I fell asleep at 6am and woke at 4pm most days, getting little to no sunlight throughout the winter. After slowly taking steps to get my life back on track, my body was my next big project. 

I started running- only 2km once a week at first, then twice a week, and by August 2015 I was doing 10km four times a week. I counted calories, cut down to about 1,400, and by the time February 2016 rolled round I was at 117lbs, having gone from a UK size 12 to a size 6 (age 20):
http://imgur.com/WjGs0Ue

I went vegan on the first day of 2016, and noticed a massive difference in my recovery time and my energy. I swapped out my 4 runs for 3 lifting sessions and 1 run a week, and loved it. However, at 117lbs I wasn't eating anywhere near as much as I wanted to be able to, and I disliked feeling... small. So I decided to slowly bulk my way up again. I started at about 1,900 calories, and it did... nothing. I increased bit by bit (I was afraid of suddenly putting on a ton of fat, so I was far too careful), and eventually found that my sweet spot for gaining 0.5lbs a week was at an unexpected 2,350 calories a day, at a 50:30:20 (C,F,P) Macro split. I've stuck with that since about August time, and I'm finally here, at 128lbs (age 21):

Am I where I want to be yet? No, I intend to bulk up to 135lbs and then cut over the summer, because right now I feel a bit soft on the exterior. But I'm happy with what my body can do, and the wonders that getting in shape have done for my physical and mental health, allowing me to manage my sleep disorders, IBS and anxiety far better than I ever did. I'm excited about what the next year holds. :)",5vq8yo,n/a,2017-02-23 13:01:38

It is amazing how strong the desire to stress eat is,"Yesterday, I had significant conflict with a loved one that lead to some intense emotions.  While we worked through a lot of it (in a respectful way), I was still left emotionally drained and I was pretty surprised at how strong my desire was to stress eat.

I believe that like a lot of people I was overweight for multiple reasons.  I think for me it was a learned lifestyle that I chose to maintain, a form of entertainment and a way I managed stress.  So yesterday, I was 100% cognitively aware what was going on.   I knew that I was physically full and my desire to reach for boxes of carby food (Cheez its, Life cereal, pretzels) was for emotional comfort.  It was how I really wanted to self soothe.  I also know that the world won't end if I slip up.  That if I did comfort eat my preferred starchy food that I would have a bad day and get back on track the next day.   I also knew the relief that I felt while eating would be momentary at best.  I knew that I would end up bloated and unhappy.  Ultimately, I knew I would still feel sad and be drained from the earlier conflict.  So, I didn't eat but let me tell you, the desire to eat was so, so strong.",mgedt1,n/a,2021-03-30 12:01:52

I've found myself a neat little life hack to deal with emotional eating,"Hello fellow redditors,

I've accidentally stumbled upon a neat little life hack, and I wondered if other people do it too.

I struggle a lot with emotional eating/stress eating, and this past month I've been trying to replace it with healthier coping mechanisms. One thing that's helped me a lot is to treat each instance when I'm overwhelmed/stressed like a practise run. Like - oh, I could use this chance to go out for a walk, and see if that helps. Or I'll think of one of the healthier alternatives I came up with earlier and try it out - and actually be able to see if it works for me or not.

&#x200B;

I think it's the ""getting outside the problem"" that helps me - instead of marinating in my misery, it changes the perspective of my emotional state.

&#x200B;

Dunno if this'll help anyone, but just wanted to share.

AITAH for installing a lock on my fridge to stop my roommate from ‘stress-eating’ my food?,"So, I (30F) live with my roommate, Sarah (29F), who has this habit of eating everything in the fridge, whether it’s hers or not. She always says it’s because she’s “stressed” and swears she’ll replace it, but my groceries vanish faster than a dating app match after mentioning kids. The last straw was when she ate my emotional support tiramisu. For context, I’d spent hours making this tiramisu after a rough week at work. It was my therapy in a dessert.

Sarah ate the whole thing without asking and left a note on the empty dish that said, “Sorry! PMS sucks. I owe you.” That was it. I lost it. I ordered a lock for the fridge for my food and moved everything into it. Now Sarah’s furious, saying I’ve “ruined the vibe of the apartment” and that I’m “passive-aggressive” for locking her out of the shared fridge. She even tried to rally our other roommates against me (spoiler: they also hide their snacks from her).

AITAH for locking up my food, or is Sarah just mad she can’t steal my serotonin anymore?

UPDATE(S) - 12/22
- There is a TEMPORARY lock on the fridge while we figure out a solution. 
- We have no proof to go to the cops, we have receipts from the last 6 months of grocery bills and she claims that she could have been on those grocery runs. She also took the broken lock from my roommate. 
- We’ve lived with Sarah for around 6 years now , she was one of the core girls in our group and this has only started within the last 14 months. So we care about her as a person but this behavior can’t continue. She only recently started saying it’s because we make more money than her and that it’s only fair we share since we’ve been friends for so long. 
- We’ve gone to the landlord for theft, he claims that we just need to work it out and don’t really have a leg to stand on. We also use a paying portal with him where we automatically split the rent four ways. 
- As for buying a fridge , we already bought two 400 dollar coolers and that still didn’t work. Why should we pay an additional few hundred for a fridge and our electric bills would be insane. 
- We CANNOT break the lease. We would loose our 4,800 security deposit and need to pay 9.8k for 60 days of rent until they find new tenants (& we can’t live there during the 60 days)
- Her parents are crazy strict and abusive and feel bad for going to her parents.

"I hope non-positive posts are allowed here. I've been really struggling with stress eating, lack of willpower, and depression for almost 3 years.","I am having a really hard time and feel more and more hopeless as more time goes by and my efforts at turning things around continue to fail. I struggled with weight most of my adult life until around 4 years ago when I began doing strict CICO and got down to 119 lbs, which is still a little on ""thicker"" side given how short I am, but I was for the first time ever feeling good in clothes and confident in my ability to finally achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Then I began medical school, some very stressful circumstances occurred in my family life around the same time, and I fell into stress eating. Something takes over when I am studying for an exam that I am stressed out of my mind about, and I turn into some kind of binge-eating monster who cannot chill out and focus until she's stuffed her face with every last junk food that stress is making her crave. On top of that, there is so much free food available in medical school, but it's rarely anything healthy or at least low-calorie, so I'm stuck in a constant no-win situation where I'm either riddled with guilt because I spent money I don't really have on a salad or, alternatively, because I ate the free pizza at the hospital to save the money.

I'm just stuck in a complete rut and feeling levels of self hatred and disgust that make me never want to leave my bed again, and I don't know what to do. I don't know what weight I'm up to now because I stopped weighing myself when I realized that it only ever upset me and never motivated me to finally get my act together, but I wouldn't be surprised if I was up to 150 by now. I'd like to start regular therapy to see if that did anything at all for me since the antidepressant I'm on isn't helping, but my clinical rotation schedule unfortunately makes it virtually impossible to make happen. I don't even know what the purpose of this post is other than venting some of my sadness and frustration. I graduate in about a year and really hope I can figure out a way to not be fat by then.",lqx48f,n/a,2021-02-23 23:53:36
I don't think the majority of men actually care about women,"I am appalled, I came across a discussion where the man posted if he should leave his partner because she gained 20-25 pounds. He claims to love her and then says ""It’s about her attitude change, **why doesn’t she care to look good for me anymore ?**""

That was so shocking and EYE OPENING to me, I feel like we are seen as accessories to their lives, they do not see us out own self and only how things effect them. **If my partner put on rapid weight, my first concern would be if they have a medical issue and to have them checked out instead of jumping to the conclusion they do not care to look good for me and wondering if I should leave them...**

It could have also been a mental health issue, stress eating, etc. or perhaps she is even pregnant, but nope I am surprised some men never consider any of those other factors and just ""she doesn't care to look good for me anymore"".",1i3p4fw,n/a,2025-01-17 19:54:43

I gained 20lbs from stress eating and finally doing something about it,"Last year was rough. Between job stress and a really messy relationship, I hit a breaking point. I was bingeing almost daily, barely moving, and just... didn’t care. Everything felt too overwhelming, even basic stuff like going for a walk.

The wake-up call is a friend asked me to hang out, and after climbing 4 flights of stairs, I got super dizzy, heart racing, nauseous. I literally had to sit on the floor for 10 minutes before I could stand up. That moment scared me.

I ended up quitting my job earlier this year. Since then, I’ve been slowly putting myself back together. Started going outside more, like light hiking, swimming, casual biking. I also got a NordicTrack treadmill, a Peloton bike and a Major Fitness smith machine to built a small home gym (seriously a birthday gift for my brother, but I use it more than he does😅 Shoutout to him for being my biggest hype man through this)  One habit that’s really helped me is taking weekly progress photos, measurements, and mood logs. It’s way easier to stay grounded when I can see the changes.

I’ve lost almost 10lbs so far. Still have a bit to go, but I’m feeling stronger, physically and mentally. If anyone else has dealt with emotional eating or depression weight, I’d really love to hear what helped you stay on track.",1loyw9k,n/a,2025-07-01 11:11:53
The Worst Wedding I've Ever Attended,"After recently discovering this sub and reading the stories, I wanted to share my own tale.  This happened 25 years ago, but so many of the details are burned in my brain.  Sorry for it being so long, but this was a mess (before, during, and after the wedding).

I was a groomsman for two friends getting married (or, rather, I was friends with Bride and friendly acquaintances with Groom).  Both were 20 years old, but were from evangelical families who pushed young marriage so they could start having children right away (think the Duggars without the TV deal or as many kids).  They met at church, where Groom's father was the pastor, and dated less than six months before they were engaged.  They were then married less than six months after that.

Some of the details I remember from being a part of this clusterfuck of both the wedding and the lead-up to it...

* Bride had spent years telling our entire friend group that she was going to be a virgin when she got married.  Even a month before the wedding, she was lording her virginity over the heads of our non-married, non-virgin, female friends.  That, alone, caused a lot of hurt feelings and fights.  I didn't find out about any of this, though, until well after the wedding.

* Two weeks before the wedding, Bride suddenly stopped proudly proclaiming her virginity.  No one knew why until *the day of the wedding* when Bride broke down in tears while getting dressed.  As was relayed to me by a bridesmaid, Bride was terrified she was pregnant and that her marriage wasn't sacred anymore.  Did Bride and Groom have sex before the wedding?!  Nope.  She had given him a handjob in his car, during which he finished on himself and not on her.  She was so woefully naïve about sex that she thought simply getting a man's semen on her hand would get her pregnant.  To make matters more awkward, she refused to believe the bridesmaids when they told her pregnancy doesn't work that way.  She only calmed down when she told the story *to Groom's mother*, who promptly had a ""birds and bees"" talk with her soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

Now, onto the wedding itself...

* Due to the stress of planning the wedding and trying to navigate the expectations of her *HIGHLY* conservative, traditional, ""women should be seen and not heard"" future husband, Bride had put on quite a bit of weight from stress-eating.  I am not shaming her for that *at all*.  The problem was that she had done her dress fitting almost four months before the wedding.  When Bride's mother tried to convince her to go back in for a new fitting to account for her new size, Bride refused.  She swore up and down that she hadn't gained weight, despite half of her wardrobe no longer fitting her.  She picked up the dress a week before the wedding, but refused to try it on.  Again, she swore it would fit.  She finally tried it on the day before the wedding and had a panic attack that it didn't zip up anymore.  Her mother, a sweet and wonderful woman, stayed up until nearly dawn sewing panels into the side of the dress to make sure it would fit Bride.  Was Bride thankful for her mother's efforts?  Nope.  She bitched and moaned that the panels weren't the exact same shade of white as the rest of the dress.

* Bride's older brother (the black sheep of the devout family) brought his on-again, off-again girlfriend to the wedding.  She wore a dress that was probably two sizes too small along with *no* underwear.  We know that because, during a dance with the older brother, she interrupted her grinding on his crotch to bend over and shove her ass against him.  The promptly ripped her dress along the seam (which was on the back).  She didn't notice, apparently, because she stood up, turned around to continue grinding him, and flashed her bare ass...and more during subsequent dance moves...to the entire reception.

* I was one of two gay guys at the wedding, the other being a long-time friend (and fellow groomsman).  Groom knew we were both gay, but didn't tell his family.  Someone, though, spilled the beans to Groom's fire-and-brimstone preacher of a father.  During a slow dance, for which my friend and I were sitting at a table talking quietly, Groom's father came over and practically threatened to kill us if we danced together at the reception.  We had no intentions of dancing together.  We, from the day we met, have had zero sexual or romantic attraction to one another.  We are friends, that's all.  But, the idea of two men possibly dancing together in public sent Groom's father off the deep end.

* Groom's younger brother (14 or 15 at the time) snuck a bottle of wine away from the bar and was found drunk, puking his guts out, in the grass behind the venue.  Of course, fire-and-brimstone preacher didn't care.  He was too busy giving the side-eye to me and my gay friend for the rest of the night.

* When the party was over, Bride and Groom went to leave.  Written on the back of Groom's car wasn't ""Just Married"" or something like that.  Instead, Bride's two brothers had written ""Free to Fuck.""  Bride cried, Groom laughed and refused to wash it off.

* A few months after the wedding, I had lunch with Bride at her request.  After lunch, as I was dropping her back off and her and Groom's apartment, she told me that this would be the last time we'd speak to each other as Groom had forbidden her from having male friends, especially *gay* male friends.  When I tried to question why she was turning her back on me now after years of friendship (we met in middle school), she just said ""Groom is my husband and he is in charge.  I cannot disobey him.""

Like I said, that was 25 years ago.  True to her word (and to my own desires after that lunch), she and I have never spoken again.  In fact, no one in the friend group (who were all groomsmen and bridesmaids) spoke to either of them again.  Groom insisted that Bride cut off all men and non-virtuous (i.e. virgin and evangelical) women from her life.  Bride, like the ""proper"" evangelical wife she was, did exactly as she was ordered.",1mcgpef,n/a,2025-07-29 16:51:04
AITA for yelling at my mom because she ate the food that I bought with my money?,"
Our fridge is usually close to empty. There’s always condiments, eggs and some sort of shredded cheese but that’s it. Usually cream for coffee too which I sometimes use for cereal. The pantry is full of dried pasta, Cheerios and granola bars that are strictly for my sister. My dad locks away all of the good food for himself and wears the key around his neck like fucking Zoey101.  So there’s nothing to really make besides scrambled eggs, cereal or pasta. Yeah I should be grateful that there’s food at all but I’m sorry I can’t just live off of those things. Plus I have a really sensitive stomach so a lot of dairy and gluten will destroy my stomach.

 Yesterday, I bought my own food and left it in the fridge. Starved myself all day for as long as possible so I could eat towards the end of the day to not go to bed hungry. I got a big enough meal to eat half last night and half tonight. I don’t make enough money to buy solid meals for myself all the time so I was really looking forward to not eating the same old thing yet again. I opened the fridge today when I was hungry to the point of vomiting and the majority of my food was gone. Maybe a bite or two left but nothing I could actually get full off of. So naturally I got pissed because I’m starving, I paid for it with the little money I have in the first place and my mom didn’t even ask. So I walked into her (home) office and asked her if she ate my food. Her argument was that she thought it was old from days ago when she literally knows I came home with it last night. I even got her something too which she ate for dinner last night!!!!Then I got even more mad saying I’m starving and haven’t eaten anything in over 24 hours. She started bawling her eyes out and my dad started screaming at me for being over dramatic. Then she dramatically left the house saying she’s gonna blow off work for the rest of the day to go and get me the same meal. My dad ran out and took the keys from her before she could leave then came inside saying she’s crying. 

So not only did she eat my food, she guilt tripped me and made me feel like I’m the reason why she’s not gonna make any money today. Because she ate my food that I starved myself for. I think I feel extra guilty because we get along well but this isn’t the first time it’s happened. When I told my sister she sighed and rolled her eyes because this has happened to her too with the same excuse. All I know is that I’m mad, feel guilty and have extremely low blood sugar so I might just sleep it off or something. Am I the asshole for reacting the way I did? 

Edit:
For tiktok Reddit accounts pls don’t use this story my family lives on tiktok and it’d be bad for me. 

Edit 2: For everyone asking, I’m an adult and my sister is an adult so there’s no need for CPS. We’re both starting out college at two kinda local universities and we’re still at home because we live in an expensive area so it would be really hard to move out considering I make less than minimum wage and rely on tips while she’s too busy to have a job at all. 

My mother and I are pretty close but she’s really stressed out and anxious so I think she has some sort of stress eating issue or something. She’s really checked out from constantly working. I’m not gonna call anyone on her or my dad because we don’t snitch on our family. I don’t know how else to put it when it comes to that. Especially legal authorities. My dad is another story. A really stressful, gut wrenching awful story that I don’t have time to unpack. 

I would like to thank everyone for showing concern and kindness towards me. I really do appreciate it. I’m currently saving up to transfer to a school in Europe. Then maybe just stay there. I’m sad to leave my sister but she said she plans on joining me there too as soon as she can. ",1ccambx,n/a,2024-04-24 21:46:26

*February 18, 2025*

First, I want to be clear that I do not believe in body-shaming or food policing. Having lost 100 lbs myself and working on another 50,, I have no place to judge anyone for what they eat. I pride myself on being a generous host who makes my guests comfortable and feeds them well. Nobody leaves my house hungry has always been my rule.

The problem:
I have a friend group who meets monthly at either my or ""Joan's"" home for dinner (nobody else has enough space to host). Recently, ""Polly"" announced she had a girlfriend, which made us all happy. Polly has been lonely for a long time.

I was the first to host ""Melissa."" Melissa is 500-600 lbs. I've never met anyone that big, but I hid my surprise and was warm and welcoming. No problem; I have sturdy furniture.

For dinner, I served bowls of salad, then soup. Melissa insisted on keeping her empty bowls at the table. I didn't think much of it; I'm not Emily Post. Then I brought out the main course, two 9X13 pans of 14-layer lasagna, cut into 8 pieces each. There were 10 of us altogether. I told people to dig in as I got the bread out of the oven. When I got back to the dining room, everyone looked so shocked I thought my cat had farted (his mouse farts could suffocate an elephant). Then I saw that Melissa had four pieces of lasagna heaped on her plate, two in her salad bowl, and two in her soup bowl. Polly was glaring like ""don't you dare say a word."" Melissa seemed utterly oblivious. I didn't know what to do. I just sat down.

Joan and I shared one piece of lasagna, and everyone else got a full piece. I cut the cake into equal portions for dessert, but I had to make an extra batch of sauce and get an extra tub of ice cream out. Melissa ate at least a litre.

The next month, on Joan's turn, she served every course pre-plated, and when Melissa asked for extra, Joan apologized and said there was none (truth; Joan is very organized and precise). Melissa and Polly left right after dinner, and Polly texted Joan, berating her for ""controlling"" Melissa's eating. Polly also texted me saying she trusted I'd be sensitive to Melissa's needs on my next turn.

That turn is almost here. My plan was roast dinner (pork and beef). I can easily make lots of cheap veg and dessert, but meat is pricey right now, and I'd have to serve twice the norm to satisfy Melissa. I know I cannot just trust she'll take a tenth of what's there, considering she grabbed a whole lasagna last time.. So do I suck it up and just buy much larger roasts? Do I make a few big batches of cheap soup and biscuits and serve that rather than strain my budget? I don't want to upset Melissa or be a stingy host, but I have never dealt with someone like this before. I was obese, but I would have eaten maybe 2 pieces of lasagna. Not 8. Do I just serve a reasonable-sized meal and tell Polly and Melissa ""sorry, that's all I have""?

AITAH if I serve less food than I know my guests will want?

Edited to add... everyone in the group who doesn't cook (so 7 people before Melissa joined) chips in $25 per meal to whoever hosts. That, until inflation got so bad, covered enough of the food cost to make it feasible. Joan and I have both been simplifying our menus a bit to deal with rising costs, but the idea is to give ourselves and our friends a night off from the humdrum world and pretend we live glamorous, elegant lives. We use fine china and dress nicely and play classical music. Right before Melissa, I was going to ask if we could increase the chip-in to $30 a plate. I have the most resources out of anyone in the group, and I can afford to go out-of-pocket a bit more than Joan. None of the rest have the money, space, or culinary skills to put this together. Joan and I can cook like Julia Child. We are a ragtag lot with a variety of neurodivergences and mental health issues. These meals give us something special to look forward to.

Consensus: NTA. Commenters say it's not about Melissa's weight, it's about her not having any damn manners.

*February 19, 2025, 1 day later*

Excrement is hitting the fan right now. I thought I was safe because I knew Polly didn't use Reddit. But apparently Melissa told an online friend about 14-layer lasagna, and that friend saw the post and showed it to her. Stupid me, wanting to show off my culinary prowess! Apparently I'm not the only one this has happened to. I was silly to think ""Oh, it couldn't happen to me!""

So, Melissa and Polly are at my house now, enraged, and my dad the semi-retired crisis counsellor is talking to them whilst I wait downstairs in my suite and cry. Yes, I am hiding behind my parents, but they are calmer and more objective, and I am too anxious have a rational conversation with Polly and Melissa.

Update:, it sounds like they've split them off. Dad is in one room talking to Melissa. Mum is in another, talking to Polly. I cannot get close enough to eavesdrop, and my damn cat won't tell me what he's hearing.

Might as well take this time to answer some common questions:

1. The chip-in has been $25 per person who doesn't cook. Joan and I never pay, regardless of who hosts. So we have been working off a budget of $175 because the group is nine people and seven pay. Last night and this morning we decided to increase the chip-in to $35. As of this moment, Melissa is only invited if she sticks to appropriate portions because no matter how much she pays, the rest of the group does not want to watch her eat like that. Is that mean? I don't know. But, given the yelling from upstairs, I don't know if she or Polly will ever return.
2. For those who think I cannot have sturdy enough furniture... my dad is a very large man. My now-deceased Opa and my uncle custom-built most of the furniture in the house, least the stuff he would sit on. Dad has lost a lot, but everyone in the family has a good chair or two for him to sit on in their homes.
3. Polly has helped me through a lot and has had a very difficult life, so I am loathe to upset her. I understand now that I need to grow a spine and that I don't need to be a doormat.
4. I built this group and started the parties in part because restaurants aren't an option for all involved. We have a plethora of metal, physical, and neurospicy health issues going on. One of us has dwarfism and doesn't like being stared at. The parties are our escape from difficult lives. We dress up in vintage glam costumes we've found at thrift stores or made for ourselves and pretend that we are in Golden Age Hollywood or something. It's a big deal, and both Joan and I truly love to cook and host.
5. I like cooking fancy food because I have to cook healthfully the rest of the time for my own weight loss and my diabetic parents. I do not want my parties to turn into salad and lentil fests. I eat that the rest of the time.
6. For whoever suggested a crawded boil... we are landlocked in Canada. Beef is cheaper than crawdads around here. I haven't cooked much Southern Soul food, but it's a possibility if we don't include seafood because it costs the Earth.
7. Polly sees Melissa's issues as a disability we should accommodate. She compared it to Dad building a wheelchair ramp onto the front porch for my granny and auntie. But I now understand that letting Melissa gorge is not a kindness. it's enabling very dangerous behaviour. She could keel over in my dining room, and we do not want to deal with all the paperwork that would create.
8. I honestly did think that everyone who was morbidly obese and addicted to food got that way from trauma because my sister and I did.
9. I wasn't actually deprived of lasagna. Joan and I often share a piece. I've had bariatric surgery and cannot eat much, and Joan prefers salad and bread and only a small portion of something as rich as lasagna.
10. I'll post the recipe once I remember all of it. It's a combo of a few different ones and some right from my head. I'm extremely stressed right now, so remembering ingredients isn't working.
11. I was wrong on Melissa's weight. She's 490 lbs. My bad; I am not good at estimating those things.
12. I would be much calmer right now and not be having chest pain if this was rage-bait. I wish it was rage-bait. Sorry to disappoint.
13. Please don't call Melissa derogatory names. This is not about hating on fat people. I was looking for advice on how to approach her obesity and food addiction behaviour with fairness and compassion.

Also, thanks for all the kind and helpful things people said. Some of the douchey ones gave me a laugh, like the eejit who thought two enormous lasagnas doesn't feed 10 people. I'll write another post when things are resolved.

*February 25, 2025, 1 week later*

First off, thanks to everyone who responded kindly. I'm still working through all the private messages, and I'll get there. Also, I'm still working on remembering the whole lasagna recipe. I'll post it when I do.

First, an apology. I knew Polly didn't use Reddit, but I was foolish and didn't think that Melissa might. I was out of line with some of what I said, like calling it a live mukbang show, and for that I apologize. This post was not supposed to be about fat-shaming, and I did, in my comments, fat-shame. That is on me, and I apologize. I do not hate Melissa for being obese. My problem has solely been about the etiquette and fairness of the food consumption and the stress it puts on me to see someone binge-eat so severely when I battle that disorder.

Update...
That day they came to my house, I did eventually speak to Melissa and Polly after they calmed down. Melissa has always dreamed of having friends who would accept her as she is and be in a group where she can eat the way she does without judgment. Polly believed that I would provide that. I told them that I cannot, because I almost ate myself to death, and helping someone else do it is too much. Also, most of my other guests were uncomfortable. I said I would provide double portions to Melissa (which is a LOT of food), but no more. I did not mention the cost, because I didn't want them to offer to pay as a way around it.

They said they'd think about it, but Polly messaged me a few days later and said that she could not forgive me humiliating her partner online unless I showed true remorse by ""giving Melissa what she needs"" (an unlimited buffet at my home). So our friendship is over. Another member of the group has sided with Polly, upset at the fact that I discussed this online.

So that is where we're at. My group has shrunk. We'll grow again; there are a few people we are going to discuss who might make good additions. But we skipped this month's party because of the stress and drama.

As to whether I should have discussed it online at all... I've decided that I'm not sorry for that. I changed enough details that someone outside the circle would not recognize it. Some genders, names, ages, medical conditions, who has what career, which relatives I live with, who has what career, have been altered to preserve anonymity. I needed advice, and I thought anonymously online would be better than asking a bunch of people I knew, because I did not want to tell people who knew Melissa what happened.

>#Comments by OOP:

- 

I never brought up the possibility of Melissa and Polly paying for the excess because I didn't want that to be a pathway to this happening again. Everyone who doesn't cook does chip in for food. It's possible that Melissa might have been willing to pay for what she ate.

It felt like.... she wanted to her wants to come first no matter the consequences. She wanted everyone to put their discomfort aside for her enjoyment, and that included me with my BED being triggered. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

- 

I said some pretty foul things in my comments on the first post, like ""live mukbang show."" I do understand why Polly wanted to end the friendship. That was very wrong of me, especially because I did NOT want to present this as hateful toward fat people. I wanted to present it with compassion and help people understand how horrific food addiction is so they'd have more empathy for those plagued with it.

Polly's demand wasn't so much about creating the unlimited buffet as it was prioritizing Melissa's wishes to eat all she wanted in spite of the discomfort of other guests and allowing my own food addiction issues to be triggered. I did explain to Polly about how much it triggered me, and I think the demand was deliberate in that I should put myself in such discomfort to atone. I was wrong for the rude things I said, but I won't put myself in that danger to atone. I've been stress-eating since it happened, worse since things blew up, and I need to get it under control.

- 

We didn't consent to it. I did not consider there could be a sexual component. I mean, I like sex, but I've never linked it with food beyond whipped cream and chocolate sauce, you know? And to me, sex is a private, two-person activity, not a spectator sport.

We skipped this month's party because of all the drama. Next month, I will do a roast dinner. Usually I like to serve numerous courses, but roast dinner kind of works better when it's served together, so the only starter will be a simple consomme or, if I have slightly wilting veggies, a pureed vegetable soup. I make consomme a few times a year and pressure-can it (I love to do everything possible from scratch), and it makes it easier for dealing with my parents' diabetes because I know what's in everything. I buy my meat from a local butcher who only works with a handful of farms that practise humane livestock raising, so I can custom-order the cuts I want. Yes, I know this is privilege because my family can afford it. We aren't taking European vacations or anything, but the food is good and we have a cleaner once a week. I'd be living on rice and beans if I had to buy my own food.

Two days before the meal, I'll stud the beef roast with rosemary and garlic and the pork with sprigs of thyme and thin slices of onion. I rub some sea salt, white pepper and garlic powder on the beef and sea salt, white pepper and sage powder on the pork. Let those sit, wrapped tightly in plastic, in the fridge, for two days before roasting. Just before roasting, I'll stud the pork with thin slices of apple (slide those in beside the onion). I'll put apple juice in with the pork and red wine in with the beef. During roasting, I turn each roast several times so all sides have a chance to sit in the liquid. I favour lean meats with little marbling, so I have to make extra effort to ensure they're moist and tender.

After the roasting, I'll make two different gravies, a beef one and a pork one. There will also be Yorkshire pudding, roasted carrots, applesauce, and a bacon/apple/brussel sprout dish. Roast dinner doesn't really serve well in courses, so we'll have a simple consomme soup starter and then straight to the main course, which we will likely eat very slowly. I keep the serving dishes covered so the food stays hot.

Then a break where everyone who is able helps clean up, and then we sit around and listen to music and chat, and eventually dessert, which will be sticky toffee pudding with whisky sauce and whipped cream.

If I do it right, I'll have leftover everything. Then the next day, my mother will make fried potato cakes for breakfast (parents get up earlier than me). And she'll eat the brussel sprouts during the day because she loves them. For supper, I'll chop the leftover meat and carrots and add some peas to make a simple stew (the gravies mix nicely) and my family will eat that with bread.

Sorry if that's more info than you wanted, but I hate food waste so I wanted to show how I cook deliberately to prevent it. There's a cookbook called More with Less that is really good for showing cheap, healthy ways to cook that also avoid waste.

- 

I didn't even offer them the option to pay for her excess. It's possible she might have agreed to do so, but I think part of the fantasy is someone else just providing the food and pretending like what she's doing is normal and socially acceptable.

- 

I've been deeply conflicted about all this because I understand the food addiction side of it and don't want to make anyone's struggle worse in that regard. I mean, I needed to grow a spine and realize I had to protect my own health before someone else's, and I'm glad for people who told me to do it. But grasping how far their manipulation went has made it easier to let go of the friendship.

- 

I think Polly is taking advantage of the fact that I don't want to upset someone for being obese and she told Melissa that I wouldn't object to her eating all she wanted. I think she sees me as a safe space for Melissa to live out her compulsions unopposed. Polly might have more of a manipulative side than I thought.

- 

Early 40s. Before you judge me for hiding behind my parents, remember that I have significant neurodivergence and mental health issues. I'm still in therapy to learn to manage confrontation and the like. I used to be a very mean person (that's how I coped with the anxiety), but I hated that and have worked so hard to go in the other direction that I went too far and break down during emotional confrontation. I'm still recovering from a very dangerous bout of depression and a hospitalisation. I don't want to go back there, so I'm doing what I must. Even if it's letting my dad fight my battles.

- 

They know where I live. They've been here before. I didn't invite them in. They knocked, the cleaner let them in and called for me, and they started yelling. Once my parents figured out what was happening, they suggested I go calm down. Overbearing or not, they're trying to protect me.

I thought I'd have a few days to figure this all out, but Melissa saw the Reddit post, and she recognized it. I hadn't changed many identifying details because I'd just been thinking about Polly not seeing it.

- 

I think that's what it is. Our city is not large, and I doubt there's an actual feeder community. So they're looking for people who will support them in their lifestyle, but I just can't do it. It's triggering my own food addiction issues and upsetting to most of the other friends. Even if money wasn't a concern, I cannot do this.

- 

To be fair, nobody went hungry. I've had bariatric surgery, so I cannot eat a full piece of lasagna. Joan prefers to fill up on lighter food like salad. She and I often share one piece, which Polly knew. I think now that she told Melissa precisely how much she'd be able to load. As I look back, I see more and more how much pre-planning went into this.

- 

I always thought I did provide all-you-can-eat. I want my guests to be stuffed and satisfied. It's part of my cultural background to feed people as a gesture of love. That's why I made two lasagnas when I could have gotten by with one, cutting pieces smaller. But I've never met someone whose food addiction was that extensive. I want to be clear that I see her as sick, not an evil, greedy person.

14-Layer ""I Must Be Crazy"" Lasagna Recipe - as Requested

this is not a once-a-month recipe to add to the rotation. Also to add an ingredient I forgot. This is a special occasion, I want to show off/make someone feel incredibly special sort of recipe. I make it like twice a year for a particular group of people I love very much. I posted it because I mentioned it in another group and a bunch of people were asking.  
  
**14-Layer Lasagna**

This is my “I must be crazy” lasagna recipe that a bunch of people have asked me to post. It’s incredibly decadent but quite delicious. It’s from a mix of other recipes, including some hints from Kenji and from my mum's recipe, and some from my head. You might find yourself adjusting measurements or seasonings to suit your own palate. I tend to cook by feel and instinct, so these measurements are about the closest I can come. But lasagna really is one of those foods that nobody uses exact recipes for, so see this as a guide.

I usually make this over 2 or 3 days because it tastes better to let the sauces sit and then the assembled lasagnas sit to let the flavours mingle, but it’s still good if you have to do it all the same day. Warning… that will be one LONG day. Give yourself 8 hours from start till serving time.

First off, you need a pan at least 6 inches deep, because this thing gets TALL. Mine end up  somewhere between 4-6 inches tall, depending on how thick I make the layers. And this is 4-6 inches on a ruler, not what your last hookup told you was 4-6 inches. This recipe is for two 9X13 pans, because that’s usually how I make it. You have to cut everything in half if you're just doing one, but that's way too much work to just make one lasagna, so make two and put one in the freezer. They'll freeze well (just don't add the top cheese). Let it thaw for 2 days in the fridge before baking. It takes for freaking ever to thaw.

*A note about the meats: Veal and lamb tend to be fattier meats, so you’ll lose more volume to melted fat that you’ll need to drain out. So if you’re using lean ground beef, use more veal and lamb than you do beef if you want the meat amounts to be equal.*

***Component Ingredients:***

**Beef Sauce**:

500-650 grams ground beef (around 1-1.5 lbs)

Salt and pepper to taste

250 grams chopped onion (about a cup)

250 grams finely chopped celery (about a cup)

4 tbsp olive oil

2 cloves minced garlic

A few sprigs basil leaves, chopped finely

A few sprigs oregano leaves, chopped finely

2 bay leaves

2 tbsp fish sauce

250 ml red wine

250 ml milk

750-1000 ml pureed tomatoes (Use the higher amount if the tomatoes are fresh; you can do the lower amount if they’re canned because they’ve already reduced some)

**Lamb Sauce:**

500-650 grams ground lamb (around 1.5 lbs)

Salt and pepper to taste

250 grams chopped onion (about 1 cup)

250 grams chopped carrot (about 1 cup)

4 tbsp olive oil

2 cloves minced garlic

A few sprigs of finely chopped rosemary leaves (at least 3 tbsp)

A few sprigs of finely chopped oregano (a bit less than the rosemary)

1 tbsp cumin

1 tbsp pureed anchovy paste

250 ml dry white wine

250 ml milk

750-1000 ml pureed tomatoes (Use the higher amount if the tomatoes are fresh; you can do the lower amount if they’re canned because they’ve already reduced some)

**Veal Sauce**:

500-650 grams ground veal (around 1.5 lb)

Salt and pepper to taste

250 grams chopped onion (about 1 cup)

250 grams chopped leek (about 1 cup)

4 tbsp olive oil

2 cloves minced garlic

A few sprigs of finely chopped basil leaves

A few sprigs of finely chopped parsley

A few sprigs of finely chopped marjoram

2 tbsp fish sauce

250 ml chicken stock

250 ml milk

750-1000 ml pureed tomatoes (Use the higher amount if the tomatoes are fresh; you can do the lower amount if they’re canned because they’ve already reduced some)

*A note about sauces: If you don’t want to do three separate sauces, you can mix all three meats together. Basically, just throw all the ingredients of all of the sauces in the same pot, following the procedure I outline below. It will be tasty, with very layered, complex flavour.*

**Ricotta Cheese Blend:**

1.5 litres ricotta

750 gm grated parmigiano-reggiano or parmigiano… get the fresh stuff and grate... do not sully this beautiful piece of culinary artwork with powder, please.

500 gm grated old white cheddar

6 eggs

I cup finely chopped parsley

**Pasta:**

If you’re using premade noodles, you’ll need 18-30 *PER LASAGNA*, depending on how many you like to put on each layer. Minimum coverage is 3 noodles per layer, but I often do five to ensure max coverage, and my pans are a little bigger than 9X13. So, altogether you need 36-60. If you’re making your own pasta in sheets, remember each lasagna needs six layers of pasta.

**Top Cheese:**

1000 grams grated mozzarella and 4 large balls of fresh mozzarella. I use the ones that are like the size of a small fist. You might want more or less. Sometimes I add in some old white cheddar here, too.

***Component Instructions:***

**Meat Sauces (the procedure is the same for all three):**

*Note: Have EVERYTHING chopped, measured, and ready to go, at least for the first time you make it. Goes much easier and you won't burn anything. The herbs, I always use fresh, and unless otherwise stated, I tend to use about 2 tbsp of each in each sauce. Some people might find this a bit overpowering, so you might wish to start with less and adjust to taste halfway through the cooking process.*

Brown the meat. Drain the fat if there’s too much.

Add in salt and pepper to taste

Add vegetables, cook till onions soften some. The rest of the veg will soften nicely during the simmering, but onions don’t do that well.

Take meat and veg out of pan and set aside.

Heat olive oil in pan on medium to medium high.

Add garlic, cook for a minute or two until it starts to get a bit brown but don’t burn it

Add half the herbs and anchovy/fish sauce for those sauces, stir for just a minute to activate the flavour oils, but don’t brown or burn them

Add wine/stock immediately. Stir the pan with a wooden spoon to deglace and get the stuck bits off the bottom.

Add milk.

Add meat and veg back in.

Add tomatoes

Cook on low for 1.5-3 hours, stirring every 20 mins. You want a bit of simmering, but not too much because the stuff on the bottom will burn. Add the other half of the herbs halfway through cooking, leaving some out if you think the taste will be too strong. The sauce volume will reduce because there is a lot of water in there, but remember that you’ll need about 1.5 litres of each in the end. You can get by with less, depending on how thick you like your layers. I like mine thick, so 1.5 litres works for me. Taste your sauces at the end. You might want to adjust for flavours, adding salt or something. Depends on how you like things to taste. I’m not a huge fan of a lot of salt. Take the bay leaves out of the beef sauce.

Best to let the sauces sit overnight in the fridge if you have time, but it’s okay if you don’t.

**Ricotta Cheese Blend:**

Make this right before you assemble. Whisk the eggs, then add the ricotta and parsley, then fold in the other cheeses. It will be a bit runny, but the eggs will cook and firm it up in the oven.

**Pasta:**

Cook your noodles to *al dente* unless you’re using the kind that need no cooking. If you use cooked noodles, I advise you rinse them in cold water and throw in a bit of olive oil so they don’t stick together. Then have a huge bowlful of them ready for when it’s time to assemble.

**Top Cheese:** don’t worry about that yet; it doesn’t go on until halfway through the baking.

**Assembly:**

GREASE YOUR PANS. I mean, it’s still gonna be a mess, but this helps a bit.

If you’re not good at eyeballing measurements, divide your components into the right number of layers first. Put each meat sauce into two bowls with a bit more than a third in each, and then two bowls with the remaining sauces mixed together. So all together to make 2 lasagnas, you need 2 bowls of beef sauce, 2 bowls of veal sauce, 2 bowls of lamb sauce, and then 2 bowls of the remnants mixed up. I cannot do the math on how to divide that, so you’ll have to figure it out. All those bowls of sauce should be close to equal in amount. I like at least 500 ml for each meat sauce layer, but you can make do with a less.

For the ricotta cheese mix, you need three bowls of sauce for each lasagna, so 6 altogether. I like at least 500 ml of mix per layer. The amount in the recipe should come close.

**Assemby Order:**

Each lasagna goes in this order:

Beef sauce

Pasta

Ricotta cheese mix

Pasta

Lamb sauce

Pasta

Ricotta cheese mix

Pasta

Veal sauce

Pasta

Ricotta cheese mix

Pasta

Mix of meat sauces

**Stop there.** If you’re baking the next day, wrap them tight in plastic wrap, put them in the fridge overnight (the flavours mix better). But same-day baking is fine, too. If it's same-day baking, go to Baking Time and Temp.

If you’re baking the next day, let the lasagnas sit on the counter a bit before you put them in the oven. This is super important if you’re using a glass dish, because sometimes those crack with sudden temperature changes. I live in a cold climate, so my house is usually cool. I would not advise leaving something with raw eggs on the counter for a long time in Florida summer heat.

**Baking Temp and Time:**

I use a convection over at about 300-325 degrees F. These puppies are THICK, so you don’t want the outside to cook too fast whilst the middle is raw. So don’t go too hot, even with a convection oven. It might take you a few tries to figure out what works best for you.

Cover each lasagne with foil (***SHINY SIDE DOWN***) and bake for about an hour to a hour and a half. I do an hour if I'm making it all the same day and the sauces are warm, an hour and a half if I've chilled them overnight.

Take them out. Leave oven on.

Uncover and add the fresh and the grated mozzarella. I usually lay the fresh down in slices and then sprinkle the grated overtop. How much cheese you want is really up to you. Carefully tent the foil (***SHINY SIDE DOWN***) round the edge of each pan to prevent the edges from burning. Grease the foil if it might touch the cheese so it doesn't stick. Leave the middle open so steam can escape or the lasagna will be way too juicy. Put them back in and bake for another hour or hour and a half.

*Note on Temperature and Baking Time: Oven temperatures are really variable, so you have to pay attention. One to two hours into the baking process, cut into the middle of each lasagna, all the way down, and see if the layers are cooked through. Check again every 30 mins. The ricotta layers will be kind of firm, and of course everything’s piping hot. My oven takes almost 3 hours to bake them through after I've put them in the fridge overnight (I usually do that because I'm way too lazy to make everything the same day),, but others might be different. If you do all cooking and assembly on the same day and the sauces are hot when they go in the pan, that will reduce cooking time.*

I’ve gained the “DOGE 15”. You?,"My fellow Feds and I were taking about the constant stress since Jan20, 2025  - Russell Vought's dream - have caused us to drink more, sleep less, stress eat. One of them said, ""yeah, I'm going to gain the DOGE 15"". Then it hit me that the weight gain I've experienced has a name! No solution yet but I have a name and I will lose my DOGE 15. Am I alone in having gained weight (I'm too scared to check but I bet it's ~15 lbs.)? ",1jynp77,n/a,2025-04-14 01:49:05
What are your favorite Aldi stress-eating buys?,"I've been an Aldi enthusiast since I first checked it out around five years back, but I mostly just buy staples and haven't been too adventurous. I'm currently extremely stressed out (freshly back in school for social work at 32, about to move halfway across the country, and trying to navigate a rocky family situation as gracefully as I can while maintaining boundaries), and I think that I'm going to treat myself to a couple bag's worth of ""fun"" groceries from Aldi and then put my phone on airplane mode for a while, as my therapist told me that I need to take a break for a day or two and decompress to stay sane.

So.. if you were in my position, what Aldi products would you snag? The move is set for 8/1, and I can probably eat a bag of chicken (maybe it's time to try the buffalo strips that I've been eyeing?), a few other meal-sized things, some sweets, snacks, and wine or cider (maybe the pearsecco?). I've gotten a bit thin from the stress and am not worried about gaining weight, so that's not a factor. It's just me and my pup, Larry (he loves the jerky and will get a bag!). I avoid seafood, pickles, and ketchup, and I tend to enjoy Mexican, Italian, and comfort food in general. I've got a ~$60 budget. Thank you! 💛

Edit: I've been wanting to try the peach bellini, cinnamon mini-muffins, sherbert hummus (I've never tried hummus and wouldn't know what to pair it with, though!), and am curious about the breakfast stuff! Current faves include the evanta malbec, macarons, tortellini, and poblano salsa.",152al15,n/a,2023-07-17 18:56:46
I startled myself by thinking I was someone pretty ,"A couple days ago I was shopping for new sunglasses because I work in the woods and am constantly losing or breaking mine. I was having a shitty day. I just completed a pretty difficult course a month or so ago and I had given up the gym for a few weeks, just stress eating and feeling frustrated. I'd put on a couple pounds and while my work keeps me moving, I was angry at myself for ""letting myself go"". I even got off the dating apps for awhile because my self concept had tanked so hard over a short time. So there I was, bitterly looking at sunglasses in a store, when I decided to walk to another section and I passed a woman who was walking near me. I only saw her in my peripheral vision but I kind of straightened up automatically because she was very beautiful, with long dark hair and a cute top, and I felt self conscious being near her. I turned to see if she needed to get by me, and almost shit myself, because it was a fucking MIRROR. I was the woman I had thought was beautiful! I looked at my dumbfounded expression in the big mirror and started laughing. I felt so silly, and yet it was like a load came off my shoulders. I realized I didn't need to worry about a couple stress pounds because if I myself thought I was beautiful, my god, that's all that really mattered. I wanted to share this with other women who maybe haven't felt their best selves lately. I hope you smile lovingly at your reflection today. ",1dz39lx,n/a,2024-07-09 14:05:32
AITA for blowing up at my stepsister at her comments about my lost weight?,"My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.

When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was ""cooler"" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like ""fatass"" and ""chubster"". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).

By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.

Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  
""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  
""But you're way older!"" she whined.

I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.

AITA?

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not ""bordering"" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese.",efz1kb,n/a,2019-12-26 18:35:45
Update: My (25M) girlfriend's (25F) sex drive has completely disappeared,"Warning: long update ahead. Here's the link to the previous post- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iq1ebc/my_25m_girlfriends_25f_sex_drive_has_completely/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb

Thanks to everyone who replied to my previous post. There were some mixed responses, with some people suggesting I insist on addressing it with her because she's hiding something, with others recommending I give her time to open up on her own.

Ultimately I decided to sort of go for a combo of the two. Friday, when we were both done with work, we sat down and had a discussion.

I told her that I could give her the space and time she needed till she was ready to talk to me about it, but I couldn't leave it unaddressed. She needed to acknowledge that there atleast WAS something that she didn't feel ready to tell me, and that was fine, but she atleast needed to acknowledge its existence, if only so I stopped feeling like I was going crazy.

She started sobbing when I was done and then she started explaining everything.

Some background that I didn't mention in my previous post because it didn't really seem relevant is that my girlfriend has PCOD. One of the consequences of this is that she finds it very difficult to lose weight and has been insecure about her body for most of her life. About a year ago (completely of her own choice, I have always told her that she's beautiful to me no matter what her weight), she resolved to start losing weight, both for her health and to feel better about her body. She started going to the gym a couple times a week, and I was supportive and also cut out all my own junk food consumption in solidarity.

Since the lockdown started and gyms shut, apparently she started slowly gaining some weight back due to stress eating and lack of exercise. I am ashamed to say I did not even notice that she was torturing herself over her weight all this while. She admitted that she stopped having sex because she was terrified I would stop finding her attractive after seeing her naked. I reassured her that I think she's gorgeous and attractive no matter what and I tell her this everyday, but she was afraid that would have changed once I saw the weight she had put on.

The rest of the conversation consisted of me reassuring her that she's beautiful and her appreciating but not really believing me. After a bit, she asked me to change the topic, and I reluctantly agreed. We had a fairly quiet dinner, she was a little sad and relieved at the same time at having told me, I think. And I was busy scheming.

The next morning before work I told her she looked lovely again and she gave me a wan smile, like she appreciated it but didn't really believe me. But that was okay. I was gonna convince her. I asked her to pick up the groceries that evening because I was gonna have a meeting run late.

The moment she left home, I got to work. I dug out some fairy lights and a bunch of candles from storage and started setting them up in the living room. Made a couple of playlists and charged the speaker. Snuck down to the florist and bought a giant bouquet.

Some more background, I hate dancing because I suck massively at it, while my girlfriend loves it. She used to go dancing every month or two with her girlfriends before lockdown. I'd join in sometimes because it was worth how happy it made her, but she definitely missed it way more than me.

So when she got back, naturally I greeted her with what were probably the most ridiculous dance moves in the history of mankind.

I'm not gonna lie, folks. She laughed. She laughed a lot. She took a short video, and we both laughed while watching it later. My movement resembled a five year old practicing kung fu more than it resembled dancing, and I had stuck a rose in my ear for maximum ridiculousness. Totally worth it, though. I have no idea how she ever thought she's ugly, her smile is just so fucking radiant.

We danced like idiots for a while before I switched to the slow dance playlist. It was definitely the happiest I'd seen her in a long time. I'd been a bad boyfriend and somehow missed how much she missed everything else. I should have done it months ago.

I told her all this. Told her she's the most beautiful woman in my eyes and always will be. And yeah, we had sex. Last night was all about her. She needed to feel special and I had been missing that for too long.

I offered to make dance nights a weekly thing afterwards. Kind of as a substitute for the workouts she's been missing, if she wants. She tore up a little, she knows how much I hate dancing. She told me that wasn't necessary.

Apparently sex is just as much of a workout as dancing. And we have a lot of missed workouts to catch up on. I'm certainly not complaining.

In all seriousness though, I'm gonna dip into my savings a little and order a home treadmill. She can't afford one right now because of college bills, so I'll surprise her with it :)

Thank you to everyone who helped me out with their advice!

Edit: Oh wow, I am completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support here. Thanks for all the awards! I just logged back into this account but I promise I'm going to read each of the replies. One thing I saw pop up a couple of times that I just wanna reassure you guys about is that she's mentioned wanting a treadmill but not being able to afford one several times in the past, so I know she wants one.

However, I figured that it's dumb to take the chance, and one surprise was good enough, and if there's anything this whole experience has taught me, it's the importance of communication. So I'm going to bring it up at dinner tonight that I comfortably have enough saved up to purchase a home workout machine (since I saw cycles/ellipticals being mentioned, we'll figure out which one we want!), and that I'd love to buy one for our home for both of us to use. Thank you all so much once again for your advice!

Edit 2: RIP me, lol, the comments are coming faster than I can read them now. There's no way for me to reply to every one of them, unfortunately. There are a lot of fantastic suggestions for diets, exercise machines, dance classes and everything in between, so thank you so much for all of them! She has a great endocrinologist, who's advice she will ultimately be following, but there are some great points to bring up with him. It is really touching and overwhelming to see all this support. Thank you all so much!

Final Edit: She loved the idea of getting some equipment to do our workouts at home together, so we're going to sit down and do our research tonight before picking the one we like most. We've gotten some fantastic advice here and we'll be looking at ellipticals, bikes, rowing machines, Just Dance on the Switch and a bunch of other stuff that you guys suggested.

To all the people who commented to insist she's cheating on me because I'm a simp (lmao), thank you for setting the exemplary standard for being macho. Insulting strangers online is so delightfully masculine. The lovely folks who told me to dump her ""because she's fat"" get the ""disappointing but not unexpected shitheads"" shout-out as well.

For the overwhelming majority of people, though, I am just breathtaken by the kind and supportive comments we've gotten. Thank you for the treasure trove of advice and LPTs, and all the love! You folks are amazing!",is8ayb,n/a,2020-09-13 22:31:42

TA as I do not want this story to be associated with my main.

I(28M) have found out that my fiancee(30F) of 2 years cheated on me. We have been together for 6 years and in-love with each other. At least that's how it was for me. She has been acting more distant and became more protective of her phone for the last 2 months. At first, I was not suspicious of anything but the doubt grew more and more inside me as the time passed. Especially after asking her if there was a problem since she felt distant. She said there is no problem and that was it.

I gave in and snooped on her phone to discover she has been sexting a guy for the last 2 months. I was devastated. At the beginning of our relationship I clearly told her lying and cheating in any form are the two unforgivable actions for me. Yet, she decided to cheat on me after 5 years of relationship and we had been planning the wedding for this summer. I am not proud of that but I checked the old messages as well but there was no case of cheating other than this.

I have been thinking about it for the last few days. I tried to rationalize it and told myself I cannot be leaving a 6 years relationship because of a single mistake but after having a long talk with my oldest sister, I realized that I should respect myself and leave. She was the one who betrayed the relationship, not me.

We do not have any shared assets and lease is on my fiancee's name. I have an inherited house but it's in another city. Tomorrow, I am planning to just get important things from the house, block her from everywhere and just leave. I do not want a closure to be honest. I just want to grieve the relationship. I thought maybe I did not love her given that I want to leave her right away but it's not like that. It hurts a lot. I tend to stress eat, masturbate, doom scroll and spiral into depression in these kinds of situations. I have that experience from my early 20s. By going no contact and returning back to the city where my family lives will give me a circle that can support me.

WIBTAH if I straight up left and ghosted her without saying anything?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Wintroza** You should heavily consider to share them with important parties such as your ex's parents. Otherwise they might harass you or spread vile lies that your ex might tell them to save face.

Remember that it's easier to explain your side before people are filled with rage/doubts about your character.

It really sucks to hear what you are going through. I wish you the best of luck navigating it all.

> **OOP:** It might create legal problems though.

**Superb_Trifle513** I second all the comments that call for you to keep screenshots as evidence. If you do go ahead with ghosting, the likelihood is that without explanation from you, she's going to play the poor, abandoned fiancée and claim she has no clue why you've left. This way, if you have proof, she can't play the victim and turn you into some sort of monster.

I wouldn't personally ghost, I would have at least a conversation, even if it was only to very firmly say ""I'm leaving and I want nothing to do with you. Do not contact me or my family"" and then I would make sure they know why, however I can't judge you for just wanting to get out immediately. 

NTA.

> **OOP:** I have the screenshot texts. I do not think she would be able to victimize herself here.

**butterlytea** NTA sure an explanation would be “nice” but who cares about being nice at this point. Also I’m sure you don’t want to hear her excuses/lies. Leaving this way might be for the best if you guys need closure that can be done in the future. You can only go from here! Good luck

> **OOP:** Yes. The main thing is that I do not want to hear lies and excuses. She cheated and that's it for me. It does not matter why after that.

[Update](https://redd.it/1b5lf72) - **March 3, 2024** 

My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1b4juvt/wibtah_for_straight_up_leaving_and_ghosting_my/?sort=new) was deemed as spam for some reason and I cannot post on this subreddit with the other account.

Firstly, I will not spread screenshots on social media or anywhere. That's illegal and a low-blow even if it does not contain sexual parts. It's a private thing and I am not planning to use these unless she plays dirty.

One of my sisters came early in the morning to take me after my fiancee left for the work and we packed some small things. As the lease is on her name, I do not have furnitures and stuff. We packed clothes, accessories and other small and personal things. Her car is an SUV type so we were able to fit most of the required things thankfully. I could not take the ring though.

I left the keys under the flower pot and put a sticky on the refrigerator saying ""I know, bye"". Drive took about 7 hours and we safely arrived to the inherited house. On the ride I received countless messages and calls from unknown numbers but did not answer. Once we arrived at the home, eldest sister called me asking if we arrived. She told me fiancee called her crying around 3pm and my sister told her not to contact me, we know everything and if she tries to paint me bad in anyway we would not use only words but do not back away from showing solid proofs to people. Fiancee requested to know where I am and speak to me. My sister said I am fine and she should not contact me in any form. When fiancee said we at least deserve a closure, my sister replied ""too bad, suck it up""(not exactly that but that's how I would translate that idiom) and ended the call. I still get calls and messages from unknown numbers. In the end her father and mother called me. Surprisingly, my fiancee came clean to them and while they hoped me to give a chance to her, they respected my decision. I thanked them and wished best of luck. Her father told me he will be sending the ring's money and asked me for my bank account. He actually sent it by adjusting to inflation so I got a pretty decent money.

The house is in an almost perfect condition as we renovated it before mom passed away. It's just incredibly dusty and dirty after not being used since then. My 3 sisters will come this weekend and we'll clean it together. Eldest broke up with her girlfriend recently so she plans to live with me after her lease ends in few months. She has been complaining about the rent prices for a while. My sisters are pretty much my only family so I only informed them with some really close friends.

I am planning on going to therapy after settling here. It may sound weird how close I am with my sisters but we grew up like that. We grew up with an abusive father and as I was the only man & youngest one all of the physical and emotional abuse went towards me. We bonded with each other through trauma and they tend to be a bit protective with me. I think that history is one of the reasons I just did not want to face my ex-fiancee. I thought I got over that considering nothing happened since family therapy we took but it seems to be there. I'll get into therapy as soon as possible to understand everything and resolve the problems.

I will post if there are any updates but I just hope there will not be any. I just want to have peace and grieve right now.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Seeker_ofLight:** It sounds as if you are on the right path and have a good support system. Yay sisters for having your back!! Good luck!

>**OOP:** Thank you! I did not know what I would do if my sisters weren't there.

**Inevitable_Bunny109** OP, I am so happy for you and good for you for getting out. I read your original post. Your message to her was perfect: short, sweet, and to the point.

>**OOP:** Thank you! I tried to keep it as short as possible. Many people said it would be weird to disappear without a simple note so that's what I did.

**usurpu** this was not an easy thing to go through, it's great that your family and her parents are supportive and understanding, she made the wrong choice and has to live with the consequences of her actions

>**OOP:** Her parents are incredible people. I am glad they did not push for anything further.

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/coSb5KcPwK): **September 10, 2020**

Pretty much the title. I'm very concerned about her at this point and I have no idea what to do.

Back in April-ish, we were having sex 2-3 times a day. We live in an apartment together, she's been taking online classes for her Master's and I'm working from home since the lockdown started. At some point, she got really busy and tired with a project, so we obviously stopped having sex temporarily.

Since it's gotten over though (which was nearly 4 months ago at this point), she's turned me down every time I've tried to initiate or set the mood for sex. I have NEVER pressured her, I usually wait a couple of nights before asking again when she tells me she's not in the mood, which turned into waiting a week, which turned into waiting two weeks. At this point I'm really concerned, we've never gone anywhere near 4 months without sex before, we've both always had pretty high sex drives.

At this point it's important to note that I do NOT press the matter or pester or pressure her in any way. The moment she says she's not in the mood, I back off immediately. I don't think I've fucked up anywhere because she's always quite apologetic when she turns me down. Our relationship is pretty much perfect in every other way too, we cuddle and hug and have game nights and movie nights, it's never felt like we're drifting apart at any point. She hasn't been behaving differently, like she's upset or depressed. We give each other plenty of space too, it's not like we're constantly together, we have our own friend circles and we curl up on our own devices from time to time.

I've tried talking to her about it, but she gets really upset and keeps insisting that nothing is wrong. I drop the matter pretty quickly too because I don't want her to feel like I'm pressuring her to have sex. I just want her to let me in and tell me what's wrong.

I honestly don't care about the sex, but I know there's something she's not telling me and it's gone on long enough that I'm getting extremely worried about her.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** If I was in your place, I too wouldn't pressure her for sex, but I damn well would pressure her for an explanation. From 2 to 3 times A DAY to not at all for 4 months? I would need answers, even if she was upset at having the conversation. It's OK to want (or not want) things in a relationship, but not communicating is not ok.

> **OOP:** Thanks for the response. I don't want her to feel pressured or accused of anything but I do want an explanation. Do you have any advice on how I can be sort of firm but also make her feel comfortable at the same time?

**Commenter 2:** It’s been a very stressful year for everyone, she’s probably just feeling the pressure. I wouldn’t worry that much, if it really bothers you try doing small intimate things: head massage, cuddle etc.

> **OOP:** We've been cuddling and I've been giving her shoulder massages on a fairly regular basis, and she seems very content and happy. Everything seems completely normal except this. I want her to atleast talk about this.

**Could the girlfriend being dealing with a prior traumatic experience?**

> **OOP:** I keep worrying about a traumatic experience too, but what? We almost never leave home because of the pandemic. One of us goes occasionally to get groceries but that's about it. I'm honestly at a loss and she's not talking to me about it.

**Is the girlfriend taking any medication that might be affecting her moods?**

> **OOP:**No, she isn't taking any medication

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/8rTv6B774b): **September 13, 2020 (three days later)**

Thanks to everyone who replied to my previous post. There were some mixed responses, with some people suggesting I insist on addressing it with her because she's hiding something, with others recommending I give her time to open up on her own.

Ultimately I decided to sort of go for a combo of the two. Friday, when we were both done with work, we sat down and had a discussion.

I told her that I could give her the space and time she needed till she was ready to talk to me about it, but I couldn't leave it unaddressed. She needed to acknowledge that there atleast WAS something that she didn't feel ready to tell me, and that was fine, but she atleast needed to acknowledge its existence, if only so I stopped feeling like I was going crazy.

She started sobbing when I was done and then she started explaining everything.

Some background that I didn't mention in my previous post because it didn't really seem relevant is that my girlfriend has PCOD. One of the consequences of this is that she finds it very difficult to lose weight and has been insecure about her body for most of her life. About a year ago (completely of her own choice, I have always told her that she's beautiful to me no matter what her weight), she resolved to start losing weight, both for her health and to feel better about her body. She started going to the gym a couple times a week, and I was supportive and also cut out all my own junk food consumption in solidarity.

Since the lockdown started and gyms shut, apparently she started slowly gaining some weight back due to stress eating and lack of exercise. I am ashamed to say I did not even notice that she was torturing herself over her weight all this while. She admitted that she stopped having sex because she was terrified I would stop finding her attractive after seeing her naked. I reassured her that I think she's gorgeous and attractive no matter what and I tell her this everyday, but she was afraid that would have changed once I saw the weight she had put on.

The rest of the conversation consisted of me reassuring her that she's beautiful and her appreciating but not really believing me. After a bit, she asked me to change the topic, and I reluctantly agreed. We had a fairly quiet dinner, she was a little sad and relieved at the same time at having told me, I think. And I was busy scheming.

The next morning before work I told her she looked lovely again and she gave me a wan smile, like she appreciated it but didn't really believe me. But that was okay. I was gonna convince her. I asked her to pick up the groceries that evening because I was gonna have a meeting run late.

The moment she left home, I got to work. I dug out some fairy lights and a bunch of candles from storage and started setting them up in the living room. Made a couple of playlists and charged the speaker. Snuck down to the florist and bought a giant bouquet.

Some more background, I hate dancing because I suck massively at it, while my girlfriend loves it. She used to go dancing every month or two with her girlfriends before lockdown. I'd join in sometimes because it was worth how happy it made her, but she definitely missed it way more than me.

So when she got back, naturally I greeted her with what were probably the most ridiculous dance moves in the history of mankind.

I'm not gonna lie, folks. She laughed. She laughed a lot. She took a short video, and we both laughed while watching it later. My movement resembled a five year old practicing kung fu more than it resembled dancing, and I had stuck a rose in my ear for maximum ridiculousness. Totally worth it, though. I have no idea how she ever thought she's ugly, her smile is just so fucking radiant.

We danced like idiots for a while before I switched to the slow dance playlist. It was definitely the happiest I'd seen her in a long time. I'd been a bad boyfriend and somehow missed how much she missed everything else. I should have done it months ago.

I told her all this. Told her she's the most beautiful woman in my eyes and always will be. And yeah, we had sex. Last night was all about her. She needed to feel special and I had been missing that for too long.

I offered to make dance nights a weekly thing afterwards. Kind of as a substitute for the workouts she's been missing, if she wants. She tore up a little, she knows how much I hate dancing. She told me that wasn't necessary.

Apparently sex is just as much of a workout as dancing. And we have a lot of missed workouts to catch up on. I'm certainly not complaining.

In all seriousness though, I'm gonna dip into my savings a little and order a home treadmill. She can't afford one right now because of college bills, so I'll surprise her with it :)

Thank you to everyone who helped me out with their advice!

**Edit:** Oh wow, I am completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support here. Thanks for all the awards! I just logged back into this account but I promise I'm going to read each of the replies. One thing I saw pop up a couple of times that I just wanna reassure you guys about is that she's mentioned wanting a treadmill but not being able to afford one several times in the past, so I know she wants one.

However, I figured that it's dumb to take the chance, and one surprise was good enough, and if there's anything this whole experience has taught me, it's the importance of communication. So I'm going to bring it up at dinner tonight that I comfortably have enough saved up to purchase a home workout machine (since I saw cycles/ellipticals being mentioned, we'll figure out which one we want!), and that I'd love to buy one for our home for both of us to use. Thank you all so much once again for your advice!

**Edit 2:** RIP me, lol, the comments are coming faster than I can read them now. There's no way for me to reply to every one of them, unfortunately. There are a lot of fantastic suggestions for diets, exercise machines, dance classes and everything in between, so thank you so much for all of them! She has a great endocrinologist, who's advice she will ultimately be following, but there are some great points to bring up with him. It is really touching and overwhelming to see all this support. Thank you all so much!

**Final Edit:** She loved the idea of getting some equipment to do our workouts at home together, so we're going to sit down and do our research tonight before picking the one we like most. We've gotten some fantastic advice here and we'll be looking at ellipticals, bikes, rowing machines, Just Dance on the Switch and a bunch of other stuff that you guys suggested.

To all the people who commented to insist she's cheating on me because I'm a simp (lmao), thank you for setting the exemplary standard for being macho. Insulting strangers online is so delightfully masculine. The lovely folks who told me to dump her ""because she's fat"" get the ""disappointing but not unexpected shitheads"" shout-out as well.

For the overwhelming majority of people, though, I am just breathtaken by the kind and supportive comments we've gotten. Thank you for the treasure trove of advice and LPTs, and all the love! You folks are amazing!

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** Dance lessons, a great thing Todo as a couple.

> **OOP:** Shhh, don't give her ideas!
> 
> But in all seriousness, probably after the pandemic. It is long overdue for me to fix my woeful dance abilities haha

**OOP clarifies the differences between PCOS and PCOD**

> **OOP:** Hey! PCOS and PCOD differ just slightly and can often be mistaken for each other since they have very similar symptoms. PCOS is caused by a disorder in the endocrine system, which controls the hormonal balance of the body, whereas PCOD is due to a hormonal imbalance rather than a system issue.
I'm very sorry to hear you have it. I wish you the best of luck dealing with it.

**OOP should make sure his girlfriend is okay with getting a treadmill or it could be a major setback for her. Because she hasn’t asked for anything yet to help with her weight**

> **OOP:** You make a great point, and even though she's explicitly mentioned wanting one before, this was the comment that convinced me to bring it up with her rather than try to surprise her again. I'm going to frame it as buying one for our home for the both of us to use, so she doesn't feel targeted or guilty about me spending money. Thank you so much for the advice!

**OOP was advised to bring up a possible PCOS/PCOD related issue to his girlfriend’s doctor. She might have issues with low progesterone levels which could be the root cause**

> **OOP:** Oh wow, thanks for the heads up! I will definitely bring this up with her and we'll book a consultation ASAP. She has a regular endocrinologist already who's been very good up to this point.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update: We got married!](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThrowRA-Girlfriend/s/AakXHNexEE): **December 24, 2024 (four years later)**

Hi everyone! I spotted an end-of-year email from Reddit for this account, which reminded me of the existence of this throwaway, and I decided to do a quick Christmas Eve update on my profile page in case anyone was still interested, because a lot has happened in 4 years.

We're both doing well! We got engaged about three years ago and adopted a cat, but it went a bit downhill from there because of a bunch of different health issues that hit her consecutively. She's largely recovered from the temporary ones, and the permanent ones are a lot more under control now thanks to regular health checkups and medication, but it was a rocky couple of years (not for our relationship, just for us in general). All the medical issues also meant she hasn't worked since, which isn't an issue financially but for other reasons which I'll come to in a moment.

She's doing a lot better mentally now as well, atleast relative to last year. She still struggles with self-esteem and feeling like a burden to her loved ones, especially me, especially because of the aforementioned lack of work over the last few years. She's a lot more communicative about these things now though instead of bottling them up, so she's not let our relationship suffer for this. And I like to think that even if her self-esteem hasn't gone up, her way of coping with it is a lot healthier now, and that's an important step in the right direction. She's even been looking to get back to work over the last month or so, despite the challenges of low self-esteem, severe imposter syndrome, and having to explain a years-long absence, and I'm really proud of her for not just giving up after the hand she's been dealt health-wise.

I'm doing really well! I switched jobs and fields about a year back and I'm making a lot more money now, and I'm enjoying my work a lot more too. I actually started therapy recently as well, because there were some personal discipline issues I wanted to fix, and I ended up discovering a whole host of other issues I had repressed, and bringing them back out into the open and dealing with them has been simultaneously terrifying and liberating. But it's also made me a much better friend and partner, so looks like I'm gonna have to keep braving them for as long as it takes!

As for the biggest one (as is probably obvious from the title), we got married two months ago! We would have done it a lot earlier if she hadn't had a bunch of health issues pop up unexpectedly, but with her on the mend, we were finally able to plan and organize the thing so everyone we wanted to be there could be there. I honestly sometimes still find it surreal, like wtf I'm a husband?! It still feels like I'm dreaming sometimes and I'm still that clueless wide-eyed college kid, but I look at the woman sleeping next to me and I remember all the ways I've changed for the better, all the ways I've grown up because of her influence, and I feel really lucky to have her. And I know that I (and she) still have a lot more growing up to do, but I'm feeling this overwhelming contentedness within because we get to do all that growing up together.

I don't know if I'll update this again, maybe if I get reminded of this account sometime in the future, and something major has happened since. Until then, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone, and I hope the New Year is your best year yet!

AITA for eating all four pints of Ben and Jerry's ice cream?,"I (26f) live with a roommate (26f). We don't grocery shop together, but I have no problem with it if she ever wants any of my food. In fact, sometimes I'll tell her ""Hey, I got milk/ice cream/cookies/whatever - feel free to help yourself."" She occasionally takes me up on this. I don't ever eat her food, aside from if we're cooking together or if she made something and directly offered it to me. 

Yesterday, I went to the grocery store, and Ben and Jerry's was on sale (2 pints for $4). So I bought 4 pints of some of my favorite flavors, but also one that I knew was my roommate's favorite. When I got home, I let her know there was ice cream in the freezer and that she was welcome to help herself if she wanted any. I ate half a pint yesterday, and roommate didn't eat any.

Today, I was stressed while working (wfh), and I ended up stress eating all the remaining 3.5 pints of ice cream while my roommate was out. When she got home, she saw there was no ice cream left and completely flipped out when I told her I finished it all. She called me a glutton with no self control, and that my offer to share ice cream was really disingenuous if I was just going to pig out on it before anyone else could get to it. And she had been looking forward to a treat after work, and that I had raised her hopes up for nothing. 

I apologized, but pointed out that she could've told me she wanted some and that I should save some. Or that she could've had some last night when I first brought it home. She just lashed out at me, saying this happens way too much. That I'll pretend to be generous with food, but then gorge myself  before anyone else could get any. She then ordered doordash and shut herself in her room.

I get that she was disappointed when she got home, but I feel like it was my ice cream and I was being nice enough to even offer any at all and that she could've let me know if she wanted me to save any. AITA?",10hfyww,n/a,2023-01-21 02:07:22
AITAH for wanting to leave my boyfriend for getting fired twice in the span of 6 months?,"My boyfriend (male, 22) was fired about 6 months ago from his factory job. He and I (female, 24) have lived together for a little over a year. He worked there for over a year and was fired because of his attendance. I got my first real ""big girl job"" this time last year and have been working part-time. I can handle my side of the bills, but he cannot. I had to force him to file for unemployment and make sure he kept up with it. My mom had been helping us financially because of the loss of his job. He gets so angry anytime I tell him that he needs to buckle down and find a job because unemployment was going to end soon, and my mom could no longer help us. During this time, I went into a deep depressive episode and gained a lot of weight from stress eating. Well, just at the right time, he was hired 1 month ago. While at this new job, he was not getting along with a trainer. He was getting in trouble, being asked why he is not committed to this, what's going on, etc. Just last week, he was apparently ignoring his trainer, and she told their manager and left. My boyfriend was sent home and was told they would talk on Monday (today). I dropped him off at work today (yeah, he doesn't have a license, that's a whole other issue) and went home. He soon called me, saying they fired him. 

I picked him up from work, and he told me that they didn't want his side of the story and just fired him. First of all, would they just fire someone for 1 issue? Is he not telling me the whole truth? Over the many months of being unemployed, he would not help with house duties (I am chronically ill and disabled), he foolishly spent money on collectibles even though we had rent and bills to pay, he made zero effort into looking for a new job after I told him many times that I was in the depressive episode because of all the stress, he kept getting mad at me when I told him I didn't want sex, and just treated me bad. 

Our whole relationship has honestly been such a rollercoaster, we have broken up and gotten back together multiple times, he has ghosted me for weeks or a month... 

With all this being said, AITAH for wanting to find someone who is committed to creating a future with me, someone who can handle himself and take care of himself? I just want to feel secure and safe, and I no longer do. 

UPDATE: today I went and viewed an apartment! It was beautiful & I am first on the list. It’s veryyyyy promising. I will be out of this soon 💞",1k4viug,n/a,2025-04-22 02:26:18
How to stop stress eating processed food?,"I have no idea where to ask for advice, but i feel stuck. I'd like to lose weight for my health, but i don't feel like i have the energy to cook and i over eat. I would say stress is the issue causing the imbalance, but unfortunately i cannot control the stress (EVERYTHING is stressfull, job, trying to keep up with rent,having family living at the border with Ukraine, that kind of stress).

So what recipes do you know that are filling, healthy and i feel like i'm eating trash food while eating healthy?

AITA for incorporating healthy swaps in cooking meals after my husband specifically told me I should lose weight?,"I'm so frustrated by this! I've gained a little weight through the pandemic. Stress eating, less active, etc. I'm 5'1 and 145, so I have a good 40lbs I could lose (I was roughly 125-130 before this all happened) without issue. My husband made a point to say we'd both put on some weight and could do with a change.

Since I'm the one who does most of the cooking and grocery shopping, I started making some healthy swaps in our meals. It's the stuff you'd expect -- instead of just rice to go with a stir fry, I'd do half rice/half cauliflower rice. Instead of just potatoes for mashed potatoes, I'd swap half for caulfilower, and then tinker with the dairy involved as well. Greek yogurt for anything it can be swapped for, etc etc. 

I figured this was perfectly acceptable, because I hadn't heard a complaint. In fact, he enjoyed all of it. I've started seeing the scale go down. 

The other day, he came in while I was making fried rice to go with a stir fry, and he saw me grating the cauliflower. He asked what it was for, and I told him I used it to swap out some of the rice. HE ACTED LIKE I WAS POISONING HIM! He got SO UPSET when I talked more about the things I swap out. He acted like it was this epic betrayal of unparalleled proportions.

I told him that if it bothers him that much, I'll set aside a portion for him before I make any swaps. This wasn't enough for him, because ""What if there's leftovers?"" and ""You shouldn't be doing this to begin with!""

In the end, I told him that I'm going to just continue doing what I'm doing, and if he has such a problem with it, he can start making his own meals, and said, bluntly ""You're acting like a fucking child.""

He's been pouting like a little bitch and making passive aggressive comments about being ""soooo hungry"" and all that.

"Finally got a breast reduction I’ve been waiting for, and here’s my experience","I’m 18 years old and have a severe chronic pain condition caused by my shitty back. So for almost a year now I’ve been in the process of trying to get a breast reduction surgery to try and lighten the load on my spine. (I was a 36HH before surgery)

Because I’m in university (doing a pretty intense engineering degree) I really didn’t want to have to take time off school for the recovery, so scheduling delays were mostly on me. First time around it was scheduled for the middle of December, right after my winter exams. Got cancelled because my surgeon had an emergency cancer case come up (obviously that comes first, no biggie)

Then I scheduled it for the Friday before my February reading week (a little tight for recovery time but I was hoping). Got cancelled because the receptionists messed up the bookings. That was more frustrating, but this surgeon was really good so I knew it was best to just stay the course. 

Third time around: scheduled for May. Was told there’s no way they’d move me because I’ve been pushed back for so long. I would be home for the summer at this point, lots of time to heal, all good right? Then COVID happened. And I mean obviously everything shut down and it’s not about me. But I panicked. All elective surgeries were put on hold, many more important than a breast reduction. How long would it take to start this up again? Where would I be on the list when it did? So many unknowns. 

I spiralled pretty hard. I gained some weight from stress eating, I wasn’t exercising enough, I got out of bed only to do my job (remotely). I felt so lost and hopeless. 

But I got SO lucky. I got a call this past Friday from the surgeon that they had OR time for Tuesday. She fit me in as her very first patient. I literally didn’t even have time to stress about it before. I’m now three days post op. I’m so thankful. I’m in pain still now, but I already feel the weight off my chest (literally). 

She was able to take over 800g out of each side. The swelling will still be coming down for a month or so but I can’t wait to be a normal size. To shop at a regular bra store. To wear shirts that I like instead of just styles that fit me. This is going to make a world of difference for my life, and I can’t wait. 

Sorry this is such a long post.  

TL;DR: after three cancellations I got my reduction surgery very suddenly, and I’m so grateful.

I've gained a lot of weight and my husband finally commented on it.,"Due to a lot of personal issues (stress eating/drinking) and working 70 hour weeks over the last year I've put on about 40 pounds. I've been hating myself for a long time, feeling unattractive, and intimacy between my husband and myself has been non-existant for several months. He has been frustrated recently, and has made comments about our lack of a sex life.

From my perspective he hasn't been interested, and I attributed that to my weight gain and I told him so. He then brought up several occasions where he tried to ""come on to me"" and I shoved him away. Examples include trying to take my towel off after I came out of the shower, trying to snuggle up to me in bed and I refused to allow him to touch me under the blankets, etc.

I had truly been thinking that he found me repulsive and I was actually considering telling him to sleep with other women (he takes care of himself... still in great shape after 20 years of marriage) but when I said to him ""you have a problem with me being fat"" he looked me dead in the eye and said ""I don't have a problem with you being fat. YOU have a problem with you being fat.""

And he's right. He has never made me feel unattractive or unworthy... He is still very much attracted to me and it's my own self conscious that has prevented me from being intimate with him because I feel like I'm less than he deserves. In reality he's the same great guy he ever was and he loves me just the same.

If you play classical, then I want to hear the scent of the pine and the flowers grow. 

I would however avoid playing anything ancient found in the ruins of Babylon or Ancient Norse sites. We don’t need more plagues.",fn7lem,n/a,2020-03-22 21:27:38

Best friend is angry with me for losing weight.,"So I've done keto on and off since 2017. From 2017-2021 I was strict keto, went from 240lbs (estimate. I don't know my highest weight because I was terrified of a scale) to 147lbs and stayed between 147-153lbs for most of that. 5'7"" for reference.

And I was *healthy.* My blood sugar was fantastic, my previously 11.7 A1C dropped to 5.1 and stayed there. I had energy. I was happy. I didn't think about food constantly. 

And then covid happened, living situation went to shit, moved 2x, bought a house, my mom died, it was stressy. I stress eat. I had also started dating a new guy and while he never pressured me, I eased up on keto until it went away almost completely. Fast food, break room food, potatoes, whatever. I ate it.

So big surprise, I gained back to 229lbs. I felt awful. Blood sugar doing the diabetic dance. Depression at an all time high. Everything I worked so hard for was just gone and I knew why. My eating was out of control.

So back in June I decided to stop fucking around and get back to it. And I'm fine! After the first week, everything fell into places, food cravings went away, no more food noise. I hit 198lbs this week and was so happy for myself. It also started coming off a lot faster this time for me, I think in part because I have a different job position that I end up clocking about 20mi of walking every night and I have a dog now who requires constant activity lol.

But anyway, point of the post. My best friend asked if I would go to a sushi restaurant with her this weekend. I told her I couldn't, but suggested a different place that had sushi but also had other items I could eat. We've been to both places, they're solid. She asks why, I tell her I'm cutting back on carbs for my blood sugar and trying to get back to the weight I was when she met me.

Response? ""Okay but you should know, you looked unhealthy. You were too thin and did not look good. Women under 200lbs just look gaunt to me. You should try to find a way to take care of yourself that doesn't include restricting things you love.""

I initially let it go, and just said it was less about my looks and more about not wanting to start having heart attacks at 35 like my mother did and that I felt amazing with stable blood sugars.

""OK well it might be better for your blood sugar but it's not for your whole body."" Like ma'am. My blood sugar directly impacts every part of my body. I promise it'll all go to shit if that one thing is out of whack. 

I fell asleep and didn't respond to her after that, but woke up to a ton of messages about how she didn't know if she could continue being friends with someone on a diet, that I was killing myself and developing an ED, that I had tied my worth to my weight, and she hoped one day I could be comfortable in my body.

Like YES? That's the point! I am NOT comfortable anymore. I am tired. Things hurt. Like do I want to look good in clothes? Duh, but I also want to *feel* good. I don't want to spend the rest of my life battling highs and lows with blood sugar and crashing out after every meal. I'm not satan for also wanting to fit back into my cute clothes that I spent quite a bit of money on. 🙄",1m9264b,n/a,2025-07-25 15:26:54
AITA for telling my husband that he needs to get himself under control?,"My husband's mom died 5-6 months ago. He was very close to her. Since then, he's started stress eating and has been depressed. He seems like he's been having a existential crisis since she died. His eating is very out of control. He looks like he's gained alot of weight.

I came home from work the other day and he was eating a large bag of taco bell food. I finally told him that he needed to get a hold of himself and stop doing this shit. Then I asked him how long he planned to live like this. He just got upset and just told me to leave him alone. Then went to the guest room and didn't come out till the next day.

We haven't really sat down and talked since then. AITA? I know i was harsh but I am legitimately worried about how he's been spiraling for 6 months.",15n2h3a,n/a,2023-08-10 04:53:16
"After 86 Gambit matches, I figured out the Malfeasance boss spawn. Here's how you can get on my level","I figured out how to force the spawn through skill and practice. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get on my level, and get the boss to spawn for you:

Step 1) Kill countless high-value targets and the non-glowing yellow bars that spawn in the subsequent 3 or more waves, to no effect.

Step 2) Play more than 86 matches or less than 86 matches.

Step 3) Around match 50, leave your PS4 and stress-eat a yogurt in the kitchen while you're AFK 1v4 against a clan wondering why matchmaking didn't bother putting 3 other guys on your team for, like, the 20th time. Explain the Gambit mechanics to your cat while she freaks out because she can't tell the difference between a yogurt cup and a can of cat food.

Step 4) Lose count of how many matches you've played, and notice you somehow have a level 34 guy on your team versus a clanned 4-stack. Notice another guy on your team is seemingly jumping into the lava on purpose each time he gets 10-15 motes. Know that this will be the Malfeasance spawn, so sit up straight and frantically search for special and heavy ammo that you can't find anywhere.

Step 5) When the Malfeasance spawns for the first time like you knew it would, don't even try because it's essentially 2v4 and you only have primary ammo. Invade over and over out of spite and somehow constantly get team-wipes with your Go Figure, even though you never got them once before. Shoot primary ammo at the Malfeasance boss because you have to pass the time while the other team gets their Exotic quest because they have 4 players and you have a level 34 guy and can't even see the lava-jumper on the map when you look for him. Keep shooting primary ammo at the boss with just one other guy.

Step 6) Hear the re-skinned Servitor's shriek/explosion noises and see that, somehow, you got the Malfeasance quest.

Step 7) Be the best player in all of Destiny because your dedication and skill spawned the boss through challenging-but-rewarding mechanics on which you were able to make direct, tangible progress.

Other things I've skilled my way into in Destiny and Destiny 2:

* Dropping my first Black Hammer after 68 Crota kills
* Getting the Ghost Ghost from Eververse loot boxes after paying $25
* Getting the last piece of gear I needed to hit level 30 from Vault of Glass, long after the Dark Below released and level 30 wasn't the cap anymore
* Never even getting close to the Imago Loop Fatebringer roll after running the strike literally over 100 times
* Not getting my first Exotic this expansion until I was 575, and it was an Armamentarium that was somehow lower light than my current chest piece
* Dropping more snipers with Hip Fire Grip than Edge Transits (I kept track of it)
* Waiting 5-6 hours (actually) for the Taken Blight to spawn for the first time on Io so I could do the Whisper quest that I skipped when I was burnt out during Warmind

Follow this guide, and you too can get the Malfeasance boss to spawn through practice, skill, and having your time respected.",9krhhi,n/a,2018-10-02 15:15:26
